  answer: "Jimmy Tompkins, born Reverend James John Tompkins on September 7, 1870,\
    \ in Margaree Forks, Nova Scotia, was a Roman Catholic priest recognized as the\
    \ spiritual founder of the Antigonish Movement. This initiative aimed to uplift\
    \ impoverished fishing and mining communities in northern and eastern Nova Scotia,\
    \ Canada, through adult education, cooperatives, and rural community development.\
    \ Tompkins strongly believed in the transformative power of education and championed\
    \ economic improvement using study groups and cooperative action.\n\nTompkins\
    \ attended St. Francis Xavier University between 1888 and 1895, supporting himself\
    \ financially by teaching Greek and Mathematics during alternate semesters. He\
    \ continued his education at the Urban College of the Congregatio de Propaganda\
    \ Fide in Rome from 1897 to 1902. Upon returning to Canada, he resumed teaching\
    \ at St. Francis Xavier University and became vice-rector in 1907. During this\
    \ time, he collaborated with the Carnegie Corporation to implement various reform\
    \ efforts, including modernization in education. However, his ambitious proposal\
    \ to merge sectarian and non-sectarian colleges in the Maritime Provinces into\
    \ a single nondenominational university centered around Dalhousie University met\
    \ opposition. While Archbishop Edward McCarthy supported the idea, Bishop James\
    \ Morrison opposed it, resulting in Tompkins' reassignment as parish priest to\
    \ the small fishing village of Canso, Nova Scotia.\n\nIn Canso and nearby communities,\
    \ Tompkins encountered firsthand the struggles of impoverished fishing communities.\
    \ He responded by organizing cooperative fisheries, credit unions, stores, and\
    \ housing projects, including the Reserve Mines cooperative known as \"Tompkinsville.\"\
    \ He also initiated adult study groups and started Nova Scotia\u2019s first regional\
    \ library. These efforts laid the foundation for the Antigonish Movement, which\
    \ was later institutionalized as the Extension Department at St. Francis Xavier\
    \ University\u2014now known as the Coady International Center. Tompkins was supported\
    \ in these endeavors by his double-cousin, Father Moses Coady, along with other\
    \ figures such as Father (Dr.) Hugh MacPherson and A.B. MacDonald.\n\nTompkins'\
    \ philosophy was encapsulated in his motto: \"It is not enough to have ideas;\
    \ we have to put legs on them.\" His determination and commitment to action left\
    \ a lasting legacy of community empowerment and cooperative development. He passed\
    \ away on May 5, 1953, but his vision continues to inspire through the work of\
    \ institutions like the Coady International Center and the lasting impacts of\
    \ the Antigonish Movement."

      uplift the impoverished fishing and mining communities of northern and eastern

      financially. He furthered his education at the Urban College of the Congregatio

      centered around Dalhousie University in Halifax, he faced resistance from Catholic
      leaders. This opposition resulted in his reassignment as parish priest to Canso,
      Nova Scotia.


      In Canso and the nearby communities of Little Dover and Queensport, Tompkins
      observed the dire challenges faced by local fishing communities. He worked tirelessly
      to organize cooperatives, regional libraries, credit unions, housing associations
      like the Reserve Mines cooperative dubbed "Tompkinsville," and adult study groups.
      This grassroots movement ultimately institutionalized as the Extension Department,
      now known as the Coady International Institute at St. Francis Xavier University.
      The movement was spearheaded further by Tompkins'' double-cousin Father Moses
      Coady and other notable figures.


      Tompkins left an enduring legacy as a leader who emphasized practical action
      alongside ideas, epitomized in his motto: "It is not enough to have ideas, we
      have to put legs on them." He passed away on May 5, 1953, leaving behind a transformative
      impact through education, community empowerment, and cooperative development.'
