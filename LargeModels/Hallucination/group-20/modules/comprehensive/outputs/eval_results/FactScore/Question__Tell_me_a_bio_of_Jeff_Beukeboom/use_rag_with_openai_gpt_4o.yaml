  answer: "Jeffrey Scott Beukeboom, born on March 28, 1965, is a Canadian professional\
    \ ice hockey coach and former NHL player. He played as a defenceman for the Edmonton\
    \ Oilers and the New York Rangers. Beukeboom first showcased his hockey talents\
    \ during his junior years with the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds from 1982 to 1985.\
    \ He was drafted in the first round (19th overall) of the 1983 NHL Entry Draft\
    \ by the Edmonton Oilers. After two more years in juniors, Beukeboom joined the\
    \ Oilers, where he became known as a hard-hitting defenceman and won three Stanley\
    \ Cups.\n\nIn 1991, he was traded to the New York Rangers, where he continued\
    \ to shine as a physical and defensive presence. Beukeboom played alongside Brian\
    \ Leetch on the Rangers' top defensive pairing, where his steady defensive style\
    \ complemented Leetch's offensive play. He became a fan favorite and alternate\
    \ captain, helping lead the Rangers to a Stanley Cup victory in 1994. He also\
    \ led the Rangers in penalty minutes three seasons and is currently second on\
    \ the team's all-time list.\n\nOff the ice, Beukeboom was known for his philanthropy,\
    \ including his work with \"Ice Hockey in Harlem,\" earning the Rangers' Crumb\
    \ Bum Award for service to local youngsters in 1996. Famous for his physical play,\
    \ his career was impacted by multiple concussions, including one resulting from\
    \ a sucker-punch incident, which led to his eventual retirement in 1999. He suffered\
    \ post-concussion symptoms for two years before fully recovering.\n\nFollowing\
    \ his retirement, Beukeboom transitioned into coaching, starting as an assistant\
    \ with the Toronto Roadrunners of the AHL in 2003\u201304. He later held coaching\
    \ roles with the Barrie Colts in the OHL and served as the president and part-owner\
    \ of the Lindsay Muskies. Beyond hockey, Beukeboom is the second cousin of Adam\
    \ Beukeboom and the uncle of Johnny and Scott McGuire, who also have ties to hockey."
