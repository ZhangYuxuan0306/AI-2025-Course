  answer: "Lupe V\xE9lez (born Mar\xEDa Guadalupe Villalobos V\xE9lez on July 18,\
    \ 1908 \u2013 December 14, 1944) was a prominent Mexican-born actress, comedian,\
    \ singer, dancer, and vedette. V\xE9lez began her career in the early 1920s performing\
    \ in Mexican vaudeville. After relocating to the United States, she made her first\
    \ film appearance in a short film in 1927. By the late 1920s, during the final\
    \ years of American silent cinema, she landed leading roles in films such as *The\
    \ Gaucho* (1927), *Lady of the Pavements* (1928), and *Wolf Song* (1929).\n\n\
    Born into a financially comfortable and educated family, V\xE9lez was sent to\
    \ study at Our Lady of the Lake in San Antonio, Texas, at the age of 13, where\
    \ she learned English and studied dance. However, her education was cut short\
    \ following the onset of the Mexican Revolution.\n\nIn Mexico, V\xE9lez quickly\
    \ established herself as one of the main stars of vaudeville. Despite her fiery\
    \ personality often resulting in conflicts, she was in high demand for her talent\
    \ as well as her ability to attract public attention. She transitioned from theater\
    \ to cinema, gaining prominence in Hollywood. Known for her vivacious and bold\
    \ character both onscreen and in real life, V\xE9lez often blurred the line between\
    \ her public persona and actual personality. She was well-known for her flamboyant\
    \ lifestyle, colorful clothing, and lively presence in Hollywood social circles.\n\
    \nA trailblazer for Mexican-American representation in cinema, V\xE9lez remains\
    \ an iconic figure in 20th-century entertainment history."
