  answer: The Ottoman Empire's conquest of Greece was a gradual process that began
    with the fall of Constantinople in **1453**, marking the start of Ottoman expansion
    into Greek territory. This was followed by the capture of Athens in **1458** and
    the fall of the Despotate of the Morea (Peloponnese) in **1460**, which completed
    the conquest of mainland Greece. By the **early 16th century**, most of mainland
    Greece and the Aegean islands were under Ottoman control. However, several territories
    under Venetian rule, such as Cyprus and Crete, resisted longer, falling to the
    Ottomans in **1571** and **1670**, respectively. The Ionian Islands remained Venetian
    until **1797**, escaping Ottoman rule entirely. Therefore, the conquest spanned
    from **1453 to the early 16th century**, with some regions falling under Ottoman
    control later.

    answer: Different parts of Greece were taken by the Ottoman Empire at different
      times, with some being untaken by the Ottomans. In 1453, the Ottoman Empire
      took over all of mainland Greece except for the Despotate of the Morea, which
      fell to the Ottomans in 1460, completing the takeover of mainland Greece. In
      1458, the Ottomans took over Athens, the capital and largest city of Greece.
      In 1670, the Ottoman Empire completed its takeover of Greece except for the
      Ionian Islands, the only part of the Greek-speaking world that escaped Ottoman
      rule, which remained Venetian until 1797.
