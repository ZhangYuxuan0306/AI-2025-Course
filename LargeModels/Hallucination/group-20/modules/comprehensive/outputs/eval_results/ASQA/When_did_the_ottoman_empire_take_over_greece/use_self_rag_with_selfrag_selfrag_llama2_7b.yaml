  answer: The Ottoman Empire took over Greece in 1458 [1].
  dataitem:
    answer: Different parts of Greece were taken by the Ottoman Empire at different
      times, with some being untaken by the Ottomans. In 1453, the Ottoman Empire
      took over all of mainland Greece except for the Despotate of the Morea, which
      fell to the Ottomans in 1460, completing the takeover of mainland Greece. In
      1458, the Ottomans took over Athens, the capital and largest city of Greece.
      In 1670, the Ottoman Empire completed its takeover of Greece except for the
      Ionian Islands, the only part of the Greek-speaking world that escaped Ottoman
      rule, which remained Venetian until 1797.
