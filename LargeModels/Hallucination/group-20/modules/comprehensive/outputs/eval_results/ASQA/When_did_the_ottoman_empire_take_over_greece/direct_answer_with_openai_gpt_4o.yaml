    \ centuries, beginning in the late **14th century** and continuing through the\
    \ **15th century**. Key events in the Ottoman takeover of Greece include:\n\n\
    1. **Battle of Kosovo (1389)**: This was part of the Ottomans\u2019 expansion\
    \ into the Balkans, which affected northern Greek areas.\n2. **Fall of Thessaloniki\

    3. **Fall of Constantinople (1453)**: Although not on modern Greek territory,\
    \ the fall of the Byzantine capital was a pivotal moment, signaling Ottoman domination\
    \ in the region.\n4. **Fall of the Despotate of the Morea (1460)**: The Peloponnese\
    \ (southern Greece), ruled by the Byzantine Despots, was taken by the Ottomans.\n\
    5. **Capture of Athens (1458)**: Athens fell under Ottoman control relatively\
    \ early in their conquests.\n\nBy the late **15th century**, most Greek territories\

    answer: Different parts of Greece were taken by the Ottoman Empire at different
      times, with some being untaken by the Ottomans. In 1453, the Ottoman Empire
      took over all of mainland Greece except for the Despotate of the Morea, which
      fell to the Ottomans in 1460, completing the takeover of mainland Greece. In
      1458, the Ottomans took over Athens, the capital and largest city of Greece.
      In 1670, the Ottoman Empire completed its takeover of Greece except for the
      Ionian Islands, the only part of the Greek-speaking world that escaped Ottoman
      rule, which remained Venetian until 1797.
