  answer: 'The Ottoman Empire gradually took over Greece during the 14th and 15th
    centuries through a series of military campaigns and annexations. Key dates include:


    - **Battle of Maritsa (1371)**: Establishing Ottoman dominance in the Balkans.

    - **Fall of Thessaloniki (1430)**: A major Greek city captured by the Ottomans.

    - **Fall of Constantinople (1453)**: While not in modern Greece, this marked the
    decline of Byzantine authority and impacted Greek territories.

    - **Fall of Athens (1458)**: Athens came under Ottoman control.

    - **Fall of the Despotate of the Morea (Peloponnese) (1460)**: Ending Byzantine
    rule in mainland Greece.


    By the late 15th century, most of Greece was under Ottoman control, though Crete,
    held by Venice, resisted until 1669.'

    answer: Different parts of Greece were taken by the Ottoman Empire at different
      times, with some being untaken by the Ottomans. In 1453, the Ottoman Empire
      took over all of mainland Greece except for the Despotate of the Morea, which
      fell to the Ottomans in 1460, completing the takeover of mainland Greece. In
      1458, the Ottomans took over Athens, the capital and largest city of Greece.
      In 1670, the Ottoman Empire completed its takeover of Greece except for the
      Ionian Islands, the only part of the Greek-speaking world that escaped Ottoman
      rule, which remained Venetian until 1797.
