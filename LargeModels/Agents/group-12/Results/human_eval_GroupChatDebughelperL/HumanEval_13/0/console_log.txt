degub_agent (to chat_manager):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `greatest_common_divisor`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `greatest_common_divisor`. However, `greatest_common_divisor` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `greatest_common_divisor` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(greatest_common_divisor)`, as well as greatest_common_divisor's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """ Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
    1
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
    5
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(greatest_common_divisor)
```
