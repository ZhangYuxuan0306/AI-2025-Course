The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `is_bored`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `is_bored`. However, `is_bored` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `is_bored` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(is_bored)`, as well as is_bored's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(is_bored)
```

Certainly! Below is a complete implementation of the `is_bored` function along with the necessary imports and test calls.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1
    """
    import re
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)
    return sum(sentence.startswith('I') for sentence in sentences)

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(is_bored)
```

### Steps to Fix and Complete:
1. **Importing `re`:** The solution requires the usage of regular expressions (`import re`) to split the text into sentences.
2. **Splitting Sentences:** Using `re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)` splits the input string `S` into individual sentences based on '.', '?', or '!' delimiters, ignoring leading spaces.
3. **Counting Boredoms:** The function counts how many of these sentences start with the word "I".

This should provide a full solution that can be run directly in Python to complete the task and pass the unit tests. Ensure you have the `my_tests.py` file available (or simulate its functionality using a mock or unit testing framework if it's not present).

The error indicates that `candidate("Is the sky blue?")` is not returning the expected result of `0`. Let's evaluate this test case and ensure the function behaves as intended.

### Analysis:
- The test case `"Is the sky blue?"` should return `0` because it does not start with "I".
- The current implementation checks for sentences starting with "I", but the string `"Is the sky blue?"` is not considered a sentence because it lacks punctuation followed by a space or ending character.

### Fix:
To fix this, we need to ensure that sentences are detected correctly and then check if they start with "I". Here's an updated implementation:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1
    """
    import re
    
    # Define a regular expression pattern for splitting sentences
    sentence_endings = r'[.?!]\s*'
    
    # Split the input string into sentences
    sentences = re.split(sentence_endings, S)
    
    # Count how many sentences start with "I"
    boredoms_count = sum(sentence.strip().startswith('I') for sentence in sentences if sentence)
    
    return boredoms_count

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(is_bored)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Splitting Sentences:** The regular expression `sentence_endings` matches '.', '?', or '!' followed by any amount of whitespace.
2. **Trimming and Checking:** After splitting, we trim each sentence to remove leading and trailing whitespace and check if it starts with "I".
3. **Counting:** We sum up the number of sentences that meet both conditions.

This should correctly handle the test case `"Is the sky blue?"` and pass all tests as expected.

It seems there was an issue with handling empty strings or incomplete sentences after splitting. Let's ensure that we cover these cases properly.

Here's the updated implementation:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1
    """
    import re
    
    # Define a regular expression pattern for splitting sentences
    sentence_endings = r'[.?!]\s*'
    
    # Split the input string into sentences and handle each sentence
    boredoms_count = sum( bool(sentence.startswith('I')) for sentence in re.split(sentence_endings, S) 
                          if sentence and any(char.isalpha() for char in sentence))  # Ensure non-empty and starts with an alphabet
    
    return boredoms_count

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(is_bored)
```

### Explanation:
- **Regular Expression Splitting:** The `re.split(sentence_endings, S)` function splits the string into sentences based on punctuation.
- **Non-empty and Starts With Alphabet Check:** We ensure that each sentence is non-empty after splitting. Additionally, we check if there are any alphabetic characters in the sentence to confirm it's a valid sentence fragment.
- **Counting Boredoms:** The `sum` function checks each sentence and counts how many of them start with "I".

This implementation should handle all provided test cases correctly, including empty strings and partial sentences. Let me know if further assistance is needed!

degub_agent (to chat_manager):

The error message indicates that `candidate("Is the sky blue?")` is returning `1`, which suggests that it's counting a non-empty and potentially incorrectly formatted sentence. Let's carefully analyze this test case to ensure we handle it correctly.

### Analysis:
- **Test Case:** `"Is the sky blue?"`.
  - This sentence starts with "I" but also ends with "?", which means it should not be counted as a boredom.
- **Current Implementation:** The implementation checks if a sentence after splitting starts with "I" and if it contains any alphabetic characters. However, there are no checks to ensure the sentence is properly formatted.

### Fix:
To address this, we need to ensure that only complete sentences (with punctuation ending) are considered for boredom checking. Let's update the implementation:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1
    """
    import re
    
    # Define a regular expression pattern for splitting sentences
    sentence_endings = r'[.?!]\s*'
    
    # Split the input string into sentences and handle each sentence
    boredoms_count = sum( bool(sentence.strip().startswith('I')) or not sentence 
                          for sentence in re.split(sentence_endings, S) if sentence)  # Ensure non-empty and check for starts with "I" after optional trailing punctuation
    
    return boredoms_count

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(is_bored)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Splitting Sentences:** The `re.split(sentence_endings, S)` function splits the string into sentences based on punctuation.
2. **Non-empty and Starts With "I" Check:** We ensure that each sentence is non-empty after splitting. If a sentence starts with "I" or lacks any alphabetic characters, it's counted as a boredom.
3. **Counting Boredoms:** The `sum` function checks each sentence and counts how many of them start with "I" or lack alphabet characters.

### Additional Testing:
Run the unit tests again to ensure that all cases are handled correctly. If issues persist, please provide any error messages or additional test cases for further review.
