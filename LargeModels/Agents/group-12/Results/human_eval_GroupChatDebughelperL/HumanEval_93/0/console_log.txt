degub_agent (to chat_manager):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `encode`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `encode`. However, `encode` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `encode` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(encode)`, as well as encode's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def encode(message):
    """
    Write a function that takes a message, and encodes in such a 
    way that it swaps case of all letters, replaces all vowels in 
    the message with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of that 
    vowel in the english alphabet. 
    Assume only letters. 
    
    Examples:
    >>> encode('test')
    'TGST'
    >>> encode('This is a message')
    'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'
    """



# Run the unit tests
