            "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a `No match found` exception, which suggests that there's an issue with the assertion in the test file. Let's review the function and the assertions to identify the problem.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Function Definition**:\n   - The `fix_spaces` function correctly handles spaces but has a logical error in how it processes consecutive spaces.\n   - When it encounters more than two consecutive spaces (`Example   3`), it incorrectly replaces them with `-`.\n\n2. **Assertions**:\n   - The assertion for `Example   3` is failing because the expected output `_Example-3_` contains an underscore before `._`, which doesn't match the function's output.\n\n### Fix\n\nThe issue lies in how consecutive spaces are handled. If a word starts with multiple spaces, all those spaces should be replaced by an underscore and then any remaining single spaces should be handled differently. Let's correct this by modifying the function:\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef fix_spaces(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a string text, replace all spaces in it with underscores, \n    and if a string has more than 2 consecutive spaces, \n    then replace all consecutive spaces with - \n    \n    fix_spaces(\"Example\") == \"Example\"\n    fix_spaces(\"Example 1\") == \"Example_1\"\n    fix_spaces(\" Example 2\") == \"_Example_2\"\n    fix_spaces(\" Example   3\") == \"-Example-3\"\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    space_count = 0\n    \n    for char in text:\n        if char == ' ':\n            space_count += 1\n        else:\n            if space_count > 2:\n                result.append('-')\n            elif space_count > 0:\n                result.extend(['_'] * space_count)\n            result.append(char)\n            space_count = 0\n    \n    # Handle trailing spaces\n    if space_count > 2:\n        result.append('-')\n    elif space_count > 0:\n        result.extend(['_'] * space_count)\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(fix_spaces)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n\n- **Space Counting**: We maintain a `space_count` to track consecutive spaces.\n- **Appending Spaces**: When an alphabet character is encountered, we append underscores and then the alphabet based on `space_count`.\n- **Trailing Spaces**: After processing all characters, we handle any trailing spaces similarly.\n\nThis should resolve the issue with the assertion. Let's run the tests again to verify that everything works as expected.",
