Your task is to find the closest vowel that stands between \n    two consonants from the right side of the word (case sensitive).\n    \n    Vowels in the beginning and ending doesn't count.

            "content": "The assertion error indicates that the function `get_closest_vowel` is not returning the expected output for the test case `\"easy\"`. Let's analyze the code and fix the issues:\n\n1. The function iterates over the word excluding the first and last characters to find a vowel surrounded by consonants.\n2. If a valid vowel is found, it should be returned immediately as the closest vowel towards the right side of the word.\n3. If no such vowel is found, an empty string should be returned.\n\nThe current implementation only handles case sensitivity and excludes vowels at the start or end of the word. Let's address these issues:\n\n1. Ensure that the function correctly checks for a valid vowel surrounded by consonants.\n2. Handle the case where there are no vowels between adjacent consonants.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef get_closest_vowel(word):\n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    # Iterate over the word excluding the first and last character\n    for i in range(1, len(word) - 1):\n        # Check if current character is a vowel and adjacent characters are consonants\n        if word[i] in vowels and word[i-1] not in vowels and word[i+1] not in vowels:\n            return word[i]\n    return \"\"\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(get_closest_vowel)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- The loop start is set to `1` to skip the first character.\n- The loop end is set to `len(word) - 1` to skip the last character.\n- The condition checks if the current character is a vowel and both adjacent characters are consonants.\n\nThis should now correctly handle all test cases, including `\"easy\"`:\n\n```python\nget_closest_vowel(\"easy\") ==> \"\"\n```",
