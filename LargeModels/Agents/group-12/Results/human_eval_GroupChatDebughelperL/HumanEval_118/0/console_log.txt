The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `get_closest_vowel`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `get_closest_vowel`. However, `get_closest_vowel` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `get_closest_vowel` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(get_closest_vowel)`, as well as get_closest_vowel's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def get_closest_vowel(word):
    """You are given a word. Your task is to find the closest vowel that stands between 
    two consonants from the right side of the word (case sensitive).
    
    Vowels in the beginning and ending doesn't count. Return empty string if you didn't
    find any vowel met the above condition. 

    You may assume that the given string contains English letter only.

    Example:
    get_closest_vowel("yogurt") ==> "u"
    get_closest_vowel("FULL") ==> "U"
    get_closest_vowel("quick") ==> ""
    get_closest_vowel("ab") ==> ""
    """

The assertion error indicates that the function `get_closest_vowel` is not returning the expected output for the test case `"easy"`. Let's analyze the code and fix the issues:

1. The function iterates over the word excluding the first and last characters to find a vowel surrounded by consonants.
2. If a valid vowel is found, it should be returned immediately as the closest vowel towards the right side of the word.
3. If no such vowel is found, an empty string should be returned.

The current implementation only handles case sensitivity and excludes vowels at the start or end of the word. Let's address these issues:

1. Ensure that the function correctly checks for a valid vowel surrounded by consonants.
2. Handle the case where there are no vowels between adjacent consonants.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def get_closest_vowel(word):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    # Iterate over the word excluding the first and last character
    for i in range(1, len(word) - 1):
        # Check if current character is a vowel and adjacent characters are consonants
        if word[i] in vowels and word[i-1] not in vowels and word[i+1] not in vowels:
            return word[i]
    return ""


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(get_closest_vowel)
```

### Key Changes:
- The loop start is set to `1` to skip the first character.
- The loop end is set to `len(word) - 1` to skip the last character.
- The condition checks if the current character is a vowel and both adjacent characters are consonants.

This should now correctly handle all test cases, including `"easy"`:

```python
get_closest_vowel("easy") ==> ""
```

        if word[i-1] not in vowels and word[i] in vowels and word[i+1] not in vowels:
            return word[i]
