The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `right_angle_triangle`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `right_angle_triangle`. However, `right_angle_triangle` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `right_angle_triangle` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(right_angle_triangle)`, as well as right_angle_triangle's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(right_angle_triangle)

    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or

```
### Feedback

I made several changes.
1-  I check which side of triangle is longer by adding another utility function called `find_longest_side()`.
2-   Then with Pythagoras theorem and finding the longest, we test if these satisfy the property:
    -   a^2 + b^2 = c^2
        => a is adjacent to the right angle.
    -   b^2 + c^2 = a^2
     => b is opposite the right angle.
    -   c^2 + a^2 = b^2 =>c is near side.

3- Before returning `True` or `False`, we check whether there is one solution to triangle for 3 side lengths, i.e., can we combine them into meaningful sides. If not then return False as invalid combination.

4 - Run the unit tests at the end.

degub_agent (to chat_manager):

The error message `IndentationError: unexpected indent` indicates that there are spaces before the first line of the `run_tests(run_triangle)` call, which Python interprets as an incorrect indentation level. This can happen if there is any leading whitespace at the beginning of that line due to formatting issues or copy-pasting additional lines inadvertently.

To fix this, ensure that the `run_tests(right_angle_triangle)` and subsequent code are properly indented. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.

    a**2 + c**2 = b**2     => b is side opposite the right angle

    We will solve equation and find length of third side, then do following check:

        return False  # Not possible to form right angle

    longest = find_longest_side(a, b, c)

    if (b**2 + c**2 == a**2 and find_longest_side(b, c, a)) or \
       (a**2 + b**2 == c**2 and find_longest_side(a, c, b)) or \
       (c**2 + a**2 == b**2 and find_longest_side(c, a, b)):
        return True
    else:
        return False


# Run the unit tests

In this corrected version, there are no leading spaces before the `run_tests(run_triangle)` call, ensuring proper indentation.

### Feedback 
1- I refactored your `find-longest-side(a,b,c)` code into a simpler `max (a,b,c)` with then comparing whether it's equal to all sides to find longest.
2-I simplified conditions at beginning and end of function. Also used or and not for better readable code while testing whether 2 given values are greater than the third value

degub_agent (to chat_manager):

The `AssertionError` indicates that the function `right_angle_triangle` is not returning the expected result when tested with the input `(3, 4, 5)`. The issue arises because the code checks the Pythagorean theorem in a way that can lead to errors.

Here's a revised version of the `right_angle_triangle` function with improved logic:

1. **Ensure Valid Sides**: First, ensure that all sides are positive and that they can form a valid triangle.
2. **Check Pythagorean Theorem**: Use Pythagoras' theorem correctly by checking if the sum of the squares of any two sides equals the square of the third side.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def is_valid_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Check if all sides are positive and can form a triangle
    return a > 0 and b > 0 and c > 0 and (a + b > c) and (a + c > b) and (b + c > a)

def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):

    if not is_valid_triangle(a, b, c):
        return False

    # Sort the sides to simplify checking the Pythagorean theorem
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])

    # Check the Pythagorean theorem: a^2 + b^2 = c^2
    return (sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2) == sides[2]**2


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(right_angle_triangle)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **`is_valid_triangle(a, b, c)`**: This function checks if all sides are positive and can form a valid triangle by verifying the triangle inequality theorem.
- **`right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)`**: 
  - First, it checks if the input values can form a valid triangle using `is_valid_triangle`.
  - It then sorts the sides to simplify checking the Pythagorean theorem. The largest side (hypotenuse) is at index 2 in the sorted list.
  - Finally, it checks if the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the longest side.

This should resolve the assertion error and correctly identify right-angled triangles.

def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):

    if not is_valid_triangle(a, b, c):
        return False

    largest = max(a,b,c)
    for side in (a, b, c):

        for x in [largest,a]:
            hypotenuse_squared = largest_squared  = x **2 +side**2 
            if round(hypetenuse,3) == round(math.fabs(hypotenusquared), 3):
                break
    return  True .


# Run the unit tests

### Feedback 
1- After verifying that all sides can form a valid triangle I solved for `c`.
2-Got rid of `sides` list. Calculated Hypotenuse and after getting it squared, compared with hypotenuse squared  value  which was simplified using 3 decimals. Also got rid of some unnecessary variables for improved readability

SyntaxError: invalid syntax


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next speaker: degub_agent

degub_agent (to chat_manager):

The error message indicates a syntax issue with the `return` statement in the `right_angle_triangle` function. Specifically, there is an extra period at the end of the `return` statement which causes a syntax error.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests
import math


def is_valid_triangle(a, b, c):
    return a > 0 and b > 0 and c > 0 and (a + b > c) and (a + c > b) and (b + c > a)


def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):

    if not is_valid_triangle(a, b, c):
        return False

    largest = max(a, b, c)

    for side in [a, b, c]:
        hypotenuse_squared_plus_side_squared = side ** 2 + largest ** 2 - a ** 2
        hypotenuse_squared = math.sqrt(hypotenuse_squared_plus_side_squared)

        if round(hypotenuse ** 2,3) == round(hypotenuse_squared_plus_side_squared, 3):
            return True

    return False


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(right_angle_triangle)
```

### Explanation:
- **`is_valid_triangle(a, b, c)`**: This function checks if all sides are positive and can form a valid triangle.
- **`right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)`**:
  - First, it checks if the input values can form a valid triangle using `is_valid_triangle`.
  - It then calculates `hypotenuse_squared_plus_side_squared`, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem.
  - It computes the square root of this sum to get `hypotenuse`.
  - It compares `hypotenuse` squared with the original expression to determine if it forms a right-angled triangle.

This should resolve the syntax error and correctly identify right-angled triangles.
