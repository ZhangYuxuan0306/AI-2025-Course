degub_agent (to chat_manager):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `correct_bracketing`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `correct_bracketing`. However, `correct_bracketing` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `correct_bracketing` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(correct_bracketing)`, as well as correct_bracketing's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """ brackets is a string of "(" and ")".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("(")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("()")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("(()())")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing(")(()")
    False
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(correct_bracketing)
