Here's how you can modify your code to include the missing part:\n\n1. Include a check at the beginning of your script to determine if `fail` is available.\n2. If `fail` is not found, provide a simple implementation of it.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\ntry:\n    from my_tests import fail\nexcept ImportError:\n    def fail(message):\n        raise AssertionError(message)\n\ndef string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The upper limit of the sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A string containing space-delimited numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return ' '.join(str(i) for i in range(n + 1)) if n >= 0 else ''\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(string_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code includes a `try-except` block to handle the case where `fail` is not available. If it's missing, it provides a basic implementation that raises an `AssertionError`. This should allow your script to run without errors.",
