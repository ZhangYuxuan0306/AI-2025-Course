degub_agent (to chat_manager):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `filter_by_substring`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `filter_by_substring`. However, `filter_by_substring` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `filter_by_substring` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(filter_by_substring)`, as well as filter_by_substring's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

from typing import List


def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings only for ones that contain given substring
    >>> filter_by_substring([], 'a')
    []
    >>> filter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
    ['abc', 'bacd', 'array']
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(filter_by_substring)
```

coder (to chat_manager):

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

from typing import List


def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Filter an input list of strings only for ones that contain given substring.

    :param strings: List of input strings
    :param substring: The substring to search for in the input strings
    :return: A new list containing only strings where the substring is found
    """
    return [s for s in strings if substring.lower() in s.lower()]


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(filter_by_substring)
```

Feedback:
Please note that this code will consider lowercase and uppercase matching for the substring. It converts both input string and substring to lower case before comparison.

If you want a more sophisticated filter (including optional flags for casing, whole word only, and ignoring certain characters), the use of regular expressions might be suitable:

```Python
import re

def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str):
    # Convert the substring into a regular expression pattern if it's an identifier:
    #   * It will preserve lower/case matching.
    #   * It will include only whole word matches by default
    #   * It will ignore common punctuation at the ends of the word
    pattern = re.compile(r'\b' + substring.lower().replace('\W', '\\\W') + r'\b')

    return [s for s in strings if pattern.search(s)]
```
