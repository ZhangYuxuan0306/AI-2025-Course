degub_agent (to chat_manager):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `encrypt`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `encrypt`. However, `encrypt` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `encrypt` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(encrypt)`, as well as encrypt's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def encrypt(s):
    """Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and
    returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated. 
    The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters 
    shift down by two multiplied to two places.
    For example:
    encrypt('hi') returns 'lm'
    encrypt('asdfghjkl') returns 'ewhjklnop'
    encrypt('gf') returns 'kj'
    encrypt('et') returns 'ix'
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(encrypt)
```
