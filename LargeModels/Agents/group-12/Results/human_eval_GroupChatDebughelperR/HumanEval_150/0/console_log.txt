degub_agent (to chat_manager):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `x_or_y`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `x_or_y`. However, `x_or_y` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `x_or_y` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(x_or_y)`, as well as x_or_y's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    """A simple program which should return the value of x if n is 
    a prime number and should return the value of y otherwise.

    Examples:
    for x_or_y(7, 34, 12) == 34
    for x_or_y(15, 8, 5) == 5
    
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(x_or_y)
```
