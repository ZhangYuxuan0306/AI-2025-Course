degub_agent (to chat_manager):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `max_element`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `max_element`. However, `max_element` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `max_element` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(max_element)`, as well as max_element's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(max_element)
```
