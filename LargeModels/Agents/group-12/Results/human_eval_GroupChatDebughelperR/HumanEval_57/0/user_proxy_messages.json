For each element, we compare it with the previous one:\n   - If the current element is greater than the previous one, we set `increasing` to `True`.\n   - If the current element is less than the previous one, we set `decreasing` to `True`.\n\n3. **Checking for Monotonicity**: During each iteration, if both `increasing` and `decreasing` are `True`, it means the list is neither monotonically increasing nor decreasing, so we return `False`.\n\n4. **Final Check**: After the loop, if either `increasing` or `decreasing` is still `False`, it means the sequence was not identified as either increasing or decreasing, and thus it should return `True` because every list with one element or less is trivially monotonic.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the list is correctly identified as monotonic based on whether it can remain monotonically increasing or decreasing throughout its length without any breaks.",
