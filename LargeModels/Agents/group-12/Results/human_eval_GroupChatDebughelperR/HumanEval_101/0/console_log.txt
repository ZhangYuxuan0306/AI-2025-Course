The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `words_string`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `words_string`. However, `words_string` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `words_string` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(words_string)`, as well as words_string's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def words_string(s):
    """
    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
    
    For example:
    words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
    """

degub_agent (to chat_manager):

The error message indicates that the function is failing an assertion test with the input `"Hi, my name is John"`. This suggests that the `split` method is not working as expected when encountering both commas and spaces.

To fix this issue, we need to handle spaces before converting all separators to commas. The current implementation is incorrectly assuming that a comma replaces multiple spaces after removing spaces, which is causing some words to be split incorrectly.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def words_string(s):
    """
    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is 
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
    
    For example:
    words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]

    """
    # Replace spaces with commas to handle both separators
    s = s.replace(' ', ',')
    
    # Split the string by commas and strip any extra whitespace from each word
    return [word.strip() for word in s.split(',')]


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(words_string)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Replace Spaces with Commas**: First, replace all spaces in the string with commas using `replace(' ', ',')`. This ensures that any sequence of spaces is replaced by a single comma.

2. **Split the String by Commas**: Use `split(',')` to split the string into substrings by commas.

3. **Strip Whitespace from Each Word**: Use a list comprehension to iterate over each substring, apply `strip()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace, and collect the results in a new list.

This should now correctly handle both commas and spaces, allowing the function to split the input string into words as intended.
