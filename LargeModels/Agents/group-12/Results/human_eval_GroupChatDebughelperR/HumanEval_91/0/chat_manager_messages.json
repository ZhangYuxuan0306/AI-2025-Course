(`[\\s.!?]+`), and handles punctuation marks that are not followed by a space.\n  \n- **Edge Cases**: The use of `(?<!\\S)[!?.]` ensures that punctuation at the start of a sentence is treated as separate.\n\nThis should correctly handle the splitting and counting of sentences, including those that may contain spaces following punctuation marks.

(`[\\s.!?]+`), and handles punctuation marks that are not followed by a space.\n  \n- **Edge Cases**: The use of `(?<!\\S)[!?.]` ensures that punctuation at the start of a sentence is treated as separate.\n\nThis should correctly handle the splitting and counting of sentences, including those that may contain spaces following punctuation marks.

Specifically, the test case `assert candidate(\"Is the sky blue?\") == 0` is failing because the function does not correctly identify a sentence that starts with \"I\". Let's break down the problem and provide a fix.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Sentence Splitting**: The sentences are being split using `.split('.')`, which handles '.', '?', and '!' as delimiters. This is not ideal for splitting punctuation marks from words. Instead, we should use a more reliable method to handle sentence boundaries, such as splitting by period followed by a space or punctuation.\n\n2. **Sentence Strip**: When checking if a sentence starts with \"I\", we should strip any leading or trailing whitespace using `s.strip()`. Otherwise, it might incorrectly count some sentences that start with \"I\" due to spaces around the word.\n\n3. **Assertion Error**: The test case `\"Is the sky blue?\"` should return 0 because it does not start with \"I\".\n\n### Solution\n\nLet's modify the `is_bored` function and update the `my_tests` module to ensure it works correctly.\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef is_bored(S):\n    \"\"\"\n    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number\n    of boredoms.

            "content": "It seems there's still an issue with the logic or the test itself. Let's carefully review and refine the approach again.\n\n### Debugging Steps\n\n1. **Sentence Splitting**: The current approach using `S.replace('?', '.').split('.')` might not properly handle sentences that split with punctuation followed by spaces. We should ensure that we correctly separate sentences without breaking them.\n\n2. **Boredom Check**: The function `starts_with_I(sentence)` needs to be more robust, ensuring it correctly identifies sentences that start with \"I.\"\n\n3. **Test Cases**: Make sure the test cases in `my_tests` are set up correctly and check if any of them might be causing failures.\n\n### Revised Approach\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n1. Split the string by various punctuation marks and extra spaces.\n2. Ensure we only count sentences that start with \"I.\"\n\nHere's a revised version of the code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef is_bored(S):\n    \"\"\"\n    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number\n    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word \"I\".\n    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.\n   \n    For example:\n    >>> is_bored(\"Hello world\")\n    0\n    >>> is_bored(\"The sky is blue. The sun is shining! I love this weather\")\n    1\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Function to check if a sentence starts with \"I\"\n    def starts_with_I(sentence):\n        return sentence.lstrip().startswith('I')\n    \n    # Split the string into sentences using regular expressions\n    sentences = re.split(r'[\\s.!?]+|(?<!\\S)[!?.]', S)\n    \n    # Count those that start with \"I\" and are not empty strings\n    boredoms = sum(1 for s in sentences if starts_with_I(s) and len(s.strip()) > 0)\n    \n    return boredoms\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(is_bored)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Regular Expression**: `re.split(r'[\\s.!?]+|(?<!\\S)[!?.]', S)` splits the string by one or more spaces followed by '.', '?', or '!' (`[\\s.!?]+`), and handles punctuation marks that are not followed by a space.\n  \n- **Edge Cases**: The use of `(?<!\\S)[!?.]` ensures that punctuation at the start of a sentence is treated as separate.\n\nThis should correctly handle the splitting and counting of sentences, including those that may contain spaces following punctuation marks. Let me know if this resolves the issue.",
