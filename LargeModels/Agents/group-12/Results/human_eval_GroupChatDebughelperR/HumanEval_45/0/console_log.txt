degub_agent (to chat_manager):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `triangle_area`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `triangle_area`. However, `triangle_area` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `triangle_area` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(triangle_area)`, as well as triangle_area's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(triangle_area)
```
