Let's fix this by ensuring that `j` is properly defined and used in the recursive function.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef is_equal_to_sum_even(n):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The input number to evaluate.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: Whether the number can be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers. If not, False is returned.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if n is less than 2, because we cannot subtract two even digits here\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n\n    base = [(i, i) for i in range(1, (n + 1)//2)]  # List of tuples where both elements sum to the number itself\n\n    def check(i, j):\n        total = i + j\n        remaining_sum = n - total\n        def recursive(s, e):\n            if s > e:\n                return False\n            else: \n                if e-s+1 == 4:\n                    return True\n                for k in range(0, ((s-e)//2) + 1):  \n                    num = remaining_sum - (k * 2)\n                    remainder = num % 2\n                    if remainder != 0 or num < 0:\n                        continue  \n                    else: \n                        result = recursive(s+k, e)\n                        return True if result == True else False\n                return False \n        \n        # Starting from j=2 instead of 1\n        for j in range(2, len(base)):\n            if check(base[j][0], base[j][1]):\n                return True\n\n        return False\n\n    # Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(is_equal_to_sum_even)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Base Case Adjustment**: The base case is slightly adjusted to handle numbers less than or equal to 2.\n2. **Recursive Function Adjustments**: The recursive function now correctly checks all possible pairs `(i, j)` from the `base` list and iterates upwards starting from `j=2`.\n3. **Variable Scope**: Ensured that `j` is defined within the scope where it's used in the nested loops.\n\nThis should resolve the issue and correctly identify numbers that can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers.",
