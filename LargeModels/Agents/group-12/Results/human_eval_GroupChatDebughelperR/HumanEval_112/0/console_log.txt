The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `reverse_delete`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `reverse_delete`. However, `reverse_delete` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `reverse_delete` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(reverse_delete)`, as well as reverse_delete's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def reverse_delete(s,c):
    """Task
    We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c
    then check if the result string is palindrome.
    A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
    You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check.
    Example
    For s = "abcde", c = "ae", the result should be ('bcd',False)
    For s = "abcdef", c = "b"  the result should be ('acdef',False)
    For s = "abcdedcba", c = "ab", the result should be ('cdedc',True)
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(reverse_delete)
