degub_agent (to chat_manager):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `solve`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `solve`. However, `solve` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `solve` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(solve)`, as well as solve's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def solve(s):
    """You are given a string s.
    if s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa, 
    otherwise keep it as it is.
    If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.
    The function should return the resulted string.
    Examples
    solve("1234") = "4321"
    solve("ab") = "AB"
    solve("#a@C") = "#A@c"
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(solve)
```
