This happens because if the input string is empty (`\"\"`), `char_list` will be an empty list, and `Counter(char_list)` will also be empty.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to check if the input string is empty before attempting to split it or use a counter on it. If the string is empty, we should return an empty dictionary immediately.\n\nHere's the updated code with this fix:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n\ndef histogram(test):\n    \"\"\"Given a string representing a space separated lowercase letters, return a dictionary\n    of the letter with the most repetition and containing the corresponding count.\n    If several letters have the same occurrence, return all of them.\n    \n    Example:\n    histogram('a b c') == {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}\n    histogram('a b b a') == {'a': 2, 'b': 2}\n    histogram('a b c a b') == {'a': 2, 'b': 2}\n    histogram('b b b b a') == {'b': 4}\n    histogram('') == {}\n\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the input string is empty\n    if not test:\n        return {}\n    \n    # Convert the input string into a list of characters\n    char_list = test.split()\n    \n    # Use Counter to count the occurrence of each character\n    counter = Counter(char_list)\n    \n    # Find the maximum count\n    max_count = max(counter.values())\n    \n    # Create a dictionary with the characters that have the maximum count and their counts\n    result = {char: count for char, count in counter.items() if count == max_count}\n    \n    return result\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\nrun_tests(histogram)\n```\n\nWith this change, the function will handle an empty input string correctly by returning an empty dictionary without attempting to calculate a maximum or process any characters.",
