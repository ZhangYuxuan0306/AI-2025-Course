It should be something like `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`.\n   - Ensure you have `unittest` imported, which is necessary to run the tests.\n\n2. **Check Python Environment:**\n   - Make sure your Python environment (virtual or otherwise) is correctly set up. You can check by running `python --version` in your terminal or command prompt.\n   - Run your script from within this environment to ensure compatibility.\n\n3. **Run `my_tests.py`:**\n   - Before running your main script, execute `my_tests.py` from the same directory where it is located. This will compile and run any tests defined in `my_tests.py`.\n\n4. **Review Logs:**\n   - If the test fails, review the logs for any additional information that might point to an issue.\n\n5. **Debugging:**\n   - If you have access to a debugger or can modify the code, add print statements or use a debugger to inspect values at different points in the `strlen` function.\n\nIf these steps resolve the issue, ensure all necessary modules and dependencies are installed and correctly configured in your environment.",
