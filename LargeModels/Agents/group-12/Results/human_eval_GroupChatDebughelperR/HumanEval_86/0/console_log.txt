The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `anti_shuffle`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `anti_shuffle`. However, `anti_shuffle` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `anti_shuffle` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(anti_shuffle)`, as well as anti_shuffle's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

The error message indicates that the `anti_shuffle` function is not returning the expected output for the test case `'hello'`. 

Upon reviewing the implementation, it seems that the function splits the input string into words and sorts each word individually. However, this approach does not correctly handle cases where words are concatenated with punctuation marks or leading/trailing spaces.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)

    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
    """
    # Split the string into words while preserving spaces
    parts = []
    current_word = ""
    for char in s:
        if char.isspace():
            if current_word:
                parts.append(current_word)
                current_word = ""
            parts.append(char)  # Preserve spaces as they are
        else:
            current_word += char

    # Sort each word individually
    sorted_text = ' '.join([''.join(sorted(word)) for word in parts])

    return sorted_text


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(anti_shuffle)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Preserve Spaces**: The function now separates words and spaces while iterating through the string. It stores spaces as they are to ensure the output maintains the original spacing.

2. **Sort each Word**: After splitting into parts, it sorts each word individually using `sorted(word)`.

3. **Join and Return**: Finally, it joins all processed parts back together.

With this change, `anti_shuffle('hello')` should now correctly return `'ehllo'`. The code block should now run without errors when executed in a Python environment that includes the `my_tests.py` module.

It seems that the function is still not handling spaces correctly or sorting words properly. Let's address these issues:

1. **Handling Spaces**: The original logic of splitting by spaces and preserving them might be incorrect. We should handle spaces separately using a temporary string buffer to accumulate words after encountering spaces.

2. **Sorting Words**: Ensure words are sorted individually, taking into account the importance of maintaining spaces around them.

3. **Preserve Case**: Remove case conversion as it wasn't specified in the instructions and can lead to errors if spaces are involved.

Here's the revised implementation:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)

    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
    """
    # Handle punctuation by removing non-alphanumeric characters
    s = ''.join(e for e in s if e.isalnum() or e.isspace())

    result = []
    current_word = ""
    space_buffer = []

    for char in s:
        if char == " ":
            # If we encounter a space, store the current word and its spaces separately
            if current_word:
                result.append(current_word)
                current_word = ""
                for _ in range(len(space_buffer)):
                    result.append(" ")
                    space_buffer.pop(0)
            space_buffer.append(" ")
        else:
            current_word += char

    # Append any remaining word after the last space
    if current_word:
        result.append(current_word)
    for _ in range(len(space_buffer)):
        result.append(" ")

    return ''.join(result)


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(anti_shuffle)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Handling Punctuation**: The function now removes any non-alphanumeric characters, ensuring words are processed correctly.

2. **Building Result**: We use a list `result` to build the final output string. `current_word` accumulates each character of a word, and `space_buffer` stores spaces encountered. When a space is encountered, we append `current_word` to the result, followed by any accumulated spaces from the buffer.

3. **Preserve Spaces**: After processing each word, spaces are preserved in the order they appear in the input string.

4. **Final Join**: Finally, the list `result` is joined into a single string and returned as the output.

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle spaces and sort words as required. You can test it with additional cases to ensure its correctness.

The error persists, likely due to the overly complex logic and handling of spaces. Let's simplify the approach to ensure that we correctly sort each word while maintaining the original order and spacing.

Here's a revised version of the `anti_shuffle` function:

1. **Extract Words**: Use regular expressions to extract words and spaces.
2. **Sort Characters in Each Word**: Sort each character within its respective word.
3. **Reconstruct the String**: Reconstruct the string by joining sorted characters and preserving original spaces.

This approach should simplify the logic and ensure correctness without unnecessary complexity:

```python
import re

def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in

    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
    """
    # Use regex to extract words and spaces
    parts = re.findall(r'\S+|\s+', s)

    result = []
    word = ''

    for part in parts:
        if part.isspace():
            # If we encounter a space, sort the characters in the current word
            if word:
                sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))
                result.append(sorted_word)
                word = ''
            result.append(part)  # Preserve spaces as they are
        else:
            word += part

    # Append any remaining character after last space at end of string
    if word:
        sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))

        if result and not result[-1].isspace():
            # Handle the case where there's no trailing space in the input string
            result[-1] += ' '

        result.append(sorted_word)

    return ''.join(result)


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(anti_shuffle)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Regex Extraction**: `re.findall(r'\S+|\s+', s)` is used to split the string into words and spaces, ensuring that only alphabetic characters (alphanumeric) are considered as part of a word.

2. **Sorting Words**: For each character in the extracted parts, if it's a space, we sort the accumulated characters (`word`) and append them to the result list along with any remaining space.

3. **Preserve Spaces**: The function maintains spaces by checking if the last processed part was a word or a space before appending sorted characters or spaces.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function handles cases where there are no trailing spaces in the input string by appending an empty space to the last token if necessary.

With this revised approach, the `anti_shuffle` function should correctly handle word sorting and maintain the original spacing, allowing the unit tests to pass.
