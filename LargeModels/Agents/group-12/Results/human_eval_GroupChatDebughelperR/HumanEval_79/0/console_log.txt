The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `decimal_to_binary`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `decimal_to_binary`. However, `decimal_to_binary` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `decimal_to_binary` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(decimal_to_binary)`, as well as decimal_to_binary's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert it to
    binary format. The function should return a string, with each character representing a binary
    number. Each character in the string will be '0' or '1'.

    There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.
    The extra characters are there to help with the format.

    Examples:
    decimal_to_binary(15)   # returns "db1111db"
    decimal_to_binary(32)   # returns "db100000db"
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(decimal_to_binary)
```

degub_agent (to chat_manager):

The error message indicates that the `run_tests(decimal_to_binary)` function encountered an assertion error at the test case for the input `0`. The expected output is `"db0db"` but the actual output was not as expected. This suggests that there might be a problem with how the binary conversion or formatting logic is working.

Let's break down the potential issues and provide a corrected version of the code:

1. **Binary Conversion**: The `bin()` function in Python returns a string starting with `'0b'` to indicate it's a binary number. This needs to be stripped off.
2. **Padding**: The padding with leading zeros is not necessary for the conversion to binary unless there's an explicit requirement to pad to a certain length (e.g., 8 bits).
3. **Error Handling**: The code already includes checks to handle non-integer inputs and negative numbers, which is good.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert it to
    binary format. The function should return a string, with each character representing a binary
    number. Each character in the string will be '0' or '1'.

    There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.
    The extra characters are there to help with the format.

    Examples:
    decimal_to_binary(15)   # returns "db1111db"
    decimal_to_binary(32)   # returns "db100000db"
    """

    if not isinstance(decimal, int):
        raise TypeError("Input must be an integer.")
    
    if decimal < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input cannot be negative.")

    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]  # Remove '0b' prefix

    extra_chars = f"db{binary}db"
    return extra_chars


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(decimal_to_binary)
```

### Key Changes:
1. **String Formatting**: Used an f-string for formatting the string `"db{binary}db"`.
2. **Removed Padding**: Removed the padding with `zfill(8)` because it was not necessary for binary conversion.

Run this code in a Python environment to verify that the tests now pass. If you still encounter issues, double-check the test cases and ensure they are correctly defined in `my_tests.py`.
