The `set` data structure automatically handles duplicates, and we then convert it back to a list to sort the results before returning them.\n\nPlease ensure you have a script named `my_tests.py` with a `run_tests` function defined, as this code assumes that exists in your environment.",

Let's walk through the requirements and ensure everything is correctly implemented.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of what the `unique_digits` function should do:\n\n1. It should take a list of positive integers.\n2. It should return a sorted list of numbers that contain only odd digits (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).\n3. The returned list should be in increasing order.\n\nLet's implement this logic step by step:\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\ndef unique_digits(x):\n    # Helper function to check if a number contains any even digit\n    def has_even_digit(n):\n        return '2' in str(n) or '4' in str(n) or '6' in str(n) or '8' in str(n)\n    \n    # Collect numbers with only odd digits and ensure uniqueness\n    result = set()\n    \n    for num in x:\n        if not has_even_digit(num):\n            result.add(num)\n    \n    # Return the sorted list of unique numbers\n    return sorted(list(result))\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(unique_digits)\n```\n\nThis implementation should now correctly filter numbers with only odd digits and return them sorted. If you continue to experience issues, please ensure that your `my_tests.py` script is functioning as expected by running it manually or checking for any errors in its output.",
