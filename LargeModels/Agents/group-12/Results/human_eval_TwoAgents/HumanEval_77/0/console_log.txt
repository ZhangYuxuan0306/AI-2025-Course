The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `iscube`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `iscube`. However, `iscube` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `iscube` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(iscube)`, as well as iscube's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def iscube(a):
    '''
    Write a function that takes an integer a and returns True 
    if this ingeger is a cube of some integer number.
    Note: you may assume the input is always valid.
    Examples:
    iscube(1) ==> True
    iscube(2) ==> False
    iscube(-1) ==> True
    iscube(64) ==> True
    iscube(0) ==> True
    iscube(180) ==> False
    '''



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(iscube)

It seems like the tests failed this time. Let's re-evaluate the implementation and ensure that we handle all edge cases correctly.

Here's a revised version of `iscube` function that accounts for negative numbers as well:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def iscube(a):
    if a < 0:
        # Handle negative input by taking the cube root of the absolute value and checking if it's an integer
        return round(abs(a) ** (1/3)) ** 3 == abs(a)
    else:
        # For non-negative numbers, check if the cube of the integer part of the cube root equals the number
        return round(a ** (1/3)) ** 3 == a


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(iscube)
```

Let's run this code to see if the tests pass now.
