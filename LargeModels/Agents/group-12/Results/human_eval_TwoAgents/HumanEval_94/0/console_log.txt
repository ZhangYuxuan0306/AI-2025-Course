user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `skjkasdkd`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `skjkasdkd`. However, `skjkasdkd` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `skjkasdkd` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(skjkasdkd)`, as well as skjkasdkd's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

    You need to find the largest prime value and return the sum of its digits.

    For lst = [1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1] the output should be 25
    For lst = [1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3] the output should be 13
