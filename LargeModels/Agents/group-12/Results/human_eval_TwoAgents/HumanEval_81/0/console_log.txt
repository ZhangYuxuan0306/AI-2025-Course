The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `numerical_letter_grade`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `numerical_letter_grade`. However, `numerical_letter_grade` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `numerical_letter_grade` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(numerical_letter_grade)`, as well as numerical_letter_grade's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def numerical_letter_grade(grades):
    """It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades
    to students. The teacher has been making her own algorithm for grading.
    The only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.
    She has given you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write 
    a function that can output a list of letter grades using the following table:
             GPA       |    Letter grade
              4.0                A+

It seems that the tests did not pass. Let's review the function and ensure it meets all the requirements specified in the comments.

Here's the revised code with some additional checks to ensure all cases are covered:

### Key Changes:
1. **Equal Check for GPA 4.0**: Added an `elif gpa == 4.0` to ensure that GPA 4.0 is handled correctly.
2. **Sorted Conditions**: Sorted the conditions in descending order to avoid potential issues with GPA boundaries.

Now, rerun the tests to see if they pass.

    The only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.
    She has given you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write 
    a function that can output a list of letter grades using the following table:
             GPA       |    Letter grade
              4.0                A+
            > 3.7                A 
            > 3.3                A- 
            > 3.0                B+
            > 2.7                B 
            > 2.3                B-
            > 2.0                C+
            > 1.7                C
            > 1.3                C-
            > 1.0                D+ 
            > 0.7                D 
            > 0.0                D-
              0.0                E
    

    Example:
    grade_equation([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) ==> ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']

    return letter_grades

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(numerical_letter_grade)
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Equal Check for GPA 4.0**: Added an `elif gpa == 4.0` to ensure that GPA 4.0 is handled correctly.
2. **Sorted Conditions**: Sorted the conditions in descending order to avoid potential issues with GPA boundaries.
3. **Documentation**: Improved comments for clarity.

Now, rerun the tests again. If they still fail, please provide any additional context or error messages from the test results to further diagnose the issue.
