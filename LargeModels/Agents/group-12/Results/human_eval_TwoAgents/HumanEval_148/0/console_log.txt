The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `bf`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `bf`. However, `bf` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `bf` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(bf)`, as well as bf's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def bf(planet1, planet2):
    '''
    There are eight planets in our solar system: the closerst to the Sun 
    is Mercury, the next one is Venus, then Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, 
    Uranus, Neptune.
    Write a function that takes two planet names as strings planet1 and planet2. 
    The function should return a tuple containing all planets whose orbits are 
    located between the orbit of planet1 and the orbit of planet2, sorted by 
    the proximity to the sun. 
    The function should return an empty tuple if planet1 or planet2
    are not correct planet names. 
    Examples
    bf("Jupiter", "Neptune") ==> ("Saturn", "Uranus")
    bf("Earth", "Mercury") ==> ("Venus")
    bf("Mercury", "Uranus") ==> ("Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn")
    '''



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(bf)
```
