The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `split_words`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `split_words`. However, `split_words` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `split_words` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(split_words)`, as well as split_words's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def split_words(txt):
    '''
    Given a string of words, return a list of words split on whitespace, if no whitespaces exists in the text you
    should split on commas ',' if no commas exists you should return the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the
    alphabet, ord('a') = 0, ord('b') = 1, ... ord('z') = 25
    Examples
    split_words("Hello world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
    split_words("Hello,world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]
    split_words("abcdef") == 3 
    '''

Great! It looks like the unit tests failed. Let's add some more test cases to ensure our implementation covers all edge cases and verify its correctness.

Here's an updated version of the code with additional test cases:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def split_words(txt):
    if ' ' in txt:
        return txt.split()
    elif ',' in txt:
        return txt.split(',')
    else:
        # Calculate the count of lower-case letters with odd order in the alphabet
        odd_count = sum(1 for char in txt if ord(char) % 2 == 1)
        return odd_count


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(split_words)
```

Now, please run this code again. If you encounter any failures, feel free to ask for further assistance!

I see that the tests still failed. Let's analyze why and try to resolve the issues.

First, let's review the implementation of `split_words`. The function checks for spaces first, then commas, and finally calculates the count of lower-case letters with odd order in the alphabet if neither is found. 

Let's consider the following edge cases:
1. An empty string should return an empty list.
2. Strings with only lowercase letters with odd order should return their count.
3. Strings with mixed characters should split by spaces and commas, but fall back to counting odd-order letters.

Here's the updated implementation:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def split_words(txt):
    if txt == '':
        return []
    
    # Check for spaces
    if ' ' in txt:
        return txt.split()
    
    # Check for commas
    elif ',' in txt:
        return txt.split(',')
    
    else:
        # Calculate the count of lower-case letters with odd order in the alphabet
        odd_count = sum(1 for char in txt if ord(char) % 2 == 1)
        return odd_count


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(split_words)
```

Let's run this code again. If you still encounter failures, please let me know!

It seems there are still some issues with the tests failing. Let's closely review the function and the test cases to ensure they align correctly.

Here's a detailed breakdown of what should happen for each type of input:

1. **Empty Input**: The function should return an empty list `[]`.
2. **Spaces in String**:
   - Should split the string into words based on spaces.
   - Example: `"Hello world!"` should become `["Hello", "world!"]`.
3. **Commas in String**:
   - Should split the string into words based on commas.
   - Example: `"Hello,world!"` should also become `["Hello", "world!"]`.
4. **Mixed Characters**:
   - Should fall back to counting the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the alphabet.
   - Example: `"abcdef"` should return `3` because 'a' (0), 'c' (2), and 'e' (4) have odd orders.
5. **Only Uppercase or Mixed with Digits**:
   - Should also fall back to counting the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the alphabet.
   - Example: `"ABC123"` should return `3` because 'A', 'B', and 'C' (0, 1, 2) have no odd orders, but any letter is a valid test case for this logic.

Given these considerations, let's adjust the function to handle these cases more robustly:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def split_words(txt):
    if txt == '':
        return []
    
    # Check for spaces
    if ' ' in txt:
        return txt.split()
    
    # Check for commas
    elif ',' in txt:
        return txt.split(',')
    
    else:
        # Calculate the count of lower-case letters with odd order in the alphabet
        odd_count = sum(1 for char in txt if char.islower() and (ord(char) - ord('a')) % 2 == 0)
        return odd_count


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(split_words)
```

Let's run this code again. If you still encounter failures, please let me know what specific test cases are failing and I can assist further.

I apologize for the oversight. Let's ensure that all possible combinations of inputs are covered by the tests. Here's a revised version of the function along with complete test cases:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def split_words(txt):
    if txt == '':
        return []
    
    # Check for spaces
    if ' ' in txt:

    # Check for commas
    elif ',' in txt:
        return txt.split(',')
    
    else:
        # Calculate the count of lower-case letters with odd order in the alphabet
        odd_count = sum(1 for char in txt if char.islower() and (ord(char) - ord('a')) % 2 == 0)
        return odd_count


# Test cases

    assert split_words("") == [], "Empty string should return an empty list"
    assert split_words("Hello world!") == ["Hello", "world!"], "Spaces in string should be split"

    assert split_words("abcdef") == 3, "Lower-case letters with odd order count"
    assert split_words("ABC123") == 0, "Uppercase and mixed digits should not affect count"
    assert split_words("xyz") == 1, "Single lowercase letter with odd order count"
    assert split_words("XYZzZz") == 1, "Single uppercase letter with odd order count"
    assert split_words("aA") == 0, "Mix of letters, one even and one odd order"
    assert split_words("!@#") == 0, "Non-alphabetic characters should not affect count"
    print("All tests passed!")

# Run the unit tests

I'm sorry for any confusion earlier. Let's ensure that all possible input scenarios are covered, especially edge cases like empty strings and non-alphabetic characters. Here's the final implementation with additional test cases:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def split_words(txt):

        return []
    
    # Try to split on spaces first

    # Try to split on commas next
    elif ',' in txt:
        return txt.split(',')
    
    else:
        # Count the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the alphabet
        # Only count if all characters are alphabetic
        if txt.isalpha():
            return sum(1 for char in txt if (ord(char) - ord('a')) % 2 == 0)
        else:
            return 0


# Test cases
def test_split_words():
    assert split_words("") == [], "Empty string should return an empty list"
    assert split_words("Hello world!") == ["Hello", "world!"], "Spaces in string should be split"
    assert split_words("Hello,world!") == ["Hello", "world!"], "Commas in string should be split"
    assert split_words("abcdef") == 3, "Lower-case letters with odd order count"
    assert split_words("ABC123") == 0, "Uppercase and mixed digits should not affect count"

    assert split_words("aA") == 0, "Mix of letters, one even and one odd order"
    assert split_words("!@#") == 0, "Non-alphabetic characters should not affect count"
    assert split_words("Hello World! ") == ["Hello", "World!"], "Spaces at the end should be ignored"
    print("All tests passed!")
