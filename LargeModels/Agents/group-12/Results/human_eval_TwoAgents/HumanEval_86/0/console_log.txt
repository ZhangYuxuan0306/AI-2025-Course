The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `anti_shuffle`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `anti_shuffle`. However, `anti_shuffle` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `anti_shuffle` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(anti_shuffle)`, as well as anti_shuffle's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(anti_shuffle)
```


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

Here's a complete code block that includes the `anti_shuffle` function and runs automated unit tests:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
    """

    def sort_word(word):
        return ''.join(sorted(word))

    words = s.split()
    sorted_words = [''.join(sorted_word) if word else '' for word in words]
    return ' '.join(sorted_words)


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(anti_shuffle)
```

This code defines the `anti_shuffle` function and includes a helper function `sort_word` to sort each character in a word. It then splits the input string into words, sorts each word individually (`if word else ''` handles empty strings that might result from trimming spaces), and joins them back together with spaces in between. Finally, it runs the unit tests using `run_tests(anti_shuffle)`.

assistant (to user_proxy):

It seems there were some issues with the test cases or the implementation of `anti_shuffle`. Let's ensure the function is correctly handling all edge cases and run the tests again to verify correctness. Here's the revised code:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
    """

    def sort_word(word):
        return ''.join(sorted(word))

    words = []
    word = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isspace():
            if word:  # If there's a non-space word, add its sorted version
                words.append(sort_word(word))
                word = ''
        else:
            word += char

    # Add the last word if there is one
    if word:
        words.append(sort_word(word))

    return ' '.join(words)


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(anti_shuffle)
```

This version of `anti_shuffle` handles punctuation and ensures that only non-space characters are sorted within each word. Let's re-run the tests to see if everything works as expected.
