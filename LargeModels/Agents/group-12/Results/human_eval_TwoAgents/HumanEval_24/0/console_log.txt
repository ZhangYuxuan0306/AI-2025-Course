/workspace/scenario.py:25: DeprecationWarning: `autogen.config_list_from_json(...)` is deprecated. Please use the "autogen.LLMConfig.from_json(path="OAI_CONFIG_LIST")" method instead. Scheduled for removal in 0.11.0 version.

user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `largest_divisor`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `largest_divisor`. However, `largest_divisor` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `largest_divisor` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(largest_divisor)`, as well as largest_divisor's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n
    >>> largest_divisor(15)
    5
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(largest_divisor)
```
