The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `prod_signs`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `prod_signs`. However, `prod_signs` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `prod_signs` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(prod_signs)`, as well as prod_signs's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def prod_signs(arr):
    """
    You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return
    sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs
    of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.
    Note: return None for empty arr.

    Example:
    >>> prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9
    >>> prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0
    >>> prod_signs([]) == None
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(prod_signs)
