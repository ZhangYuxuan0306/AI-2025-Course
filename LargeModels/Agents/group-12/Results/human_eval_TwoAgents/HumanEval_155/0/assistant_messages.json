Let's take a closer look at what might have gone wrong and provide the correct implementation.\n\nThe original code was supposed to count even and odd digits in a given number.

Let's fix this by making sure to convert the number to an absolute value before processing.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef even_odd_count(num):\n    \"\"\"Given an integer. return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.\"\"\"\n    \n    # Convert the number to its absolute value to handle negative numbers\n    num = abs(num)\n    \n    # Initialize counters for even and odd digits\n    even_count = 0\n    odd_count = 0\n    \n    while num > 0:\n        # Get the last digit of the number\n        last_digit = num % 10\n        \n        # Check if the digit is even or odd and increment the respective counter\n        if last_digit % 2 == 0:\n            even_count += 1\n        else:\n            odd_count += 1\n        \n        # Remove the last digit from the number\n        num //= 10\n    \n    return (even_count, odd_count)\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(even_odd_count)\n```\n\nThis code should now correctly handle negative numbers and pass all the tests.
