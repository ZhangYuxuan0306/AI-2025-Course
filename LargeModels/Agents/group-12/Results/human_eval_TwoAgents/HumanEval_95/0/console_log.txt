The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `check_dict_case`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `check_dict_case`. However, `check_dict_case` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `check_dict_case` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(check_dict_case)`, as well as check_dict_case's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def check_dict_case(dict):
    """
    Given a dictionary, return True if all keys are strings in lower 
    case or all keys are strings in upper case, else return False.
    The function should return False is the given dictionary is empty.
    Examples:
    check_dict_case({"a":"apple", "b":"banana"}) should return True.
    check_dict_case({"a":"apple", "A":"banana", "B":"banana"}) should return False.
    check_dict_case({"a":"apple", 8:"banana", "a":"apple"}) should return False.
    check_dict_case({"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"}) should return False.
    check_dict_case({"STATE":"NC", "ZIP":"12345" }) should return True.
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(check_dict_case)
```

This code defines the `check_dict_case` function and runs the unit tests using the `run_tests` function from `my_tests`.
