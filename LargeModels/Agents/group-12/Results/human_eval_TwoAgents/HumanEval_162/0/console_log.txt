/workspace/scenario.py:25: DeprecationWarning: `autogen.config_list_from_json(...)` is deprecated. Please use the "autogen.LLMConfig.from_json(path="OAI_CONFIG_LIST")" method instead. Scheduled for removal in 0.11.0 version.

The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `string_to_md5`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `string_to_md5`. However, `string_to_md5` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `string_to_md5` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(string_to_md5)`, as well as string_to_md5's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def string_to_md5(text):
    """
    Given a string 'text', return its md5 hash equivalent string.
    If 'text' is an empty string, return None.

    >>> string_to_md5('Hello world') == '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(string_to_md5)
```
