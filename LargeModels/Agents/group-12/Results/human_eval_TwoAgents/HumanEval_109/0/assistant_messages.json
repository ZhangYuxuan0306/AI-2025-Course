Let's review and correct the logic to ensure it works as expected.\n\nThe goal is to determine if an array can be sorted by performing right shift operations. The key observation here is that if the array can be sorted with right shifts, there should not be more than one \"break point\" where the order is disrupted, and that the elements after this break point should be less than or equal to the element before it (considering the wrap-around of the array).\n\nHere's the corrected implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\ndef move_one_ball(arr):\n    \"\"\"We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The\n    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered.

The last element of the array will be moved to\n    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. \n\n    If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation\n    then return True else return False.\n    If the given array is empty then return True.\n\n    Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.\n\n    For Example:\n    \n    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True\n    Explanation: By performing 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can\n                 be achieved for the given array.\n    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False\n    Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given\n                array by performing any number of right shift operations.\n                \n    \"\"\"\n    \n    n = len(arr)\n    if n < 2:\n        return True\n\n    # Find the break points in the array\n    break_points = []\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:\n            break_points.append(i)\n\n    # An array can be sorted by right shifts if there is at most one break point\n    return len(break_points) <= 1\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(move_one_ball)\n```\n\nThis implementation should now correctly identify whether an array can be sorted by performing right shifts.",
