The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `move_one_ball`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `move_one_ball`. However, `move_one_ball` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `move_one_ball` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(move_one_ball)`, as well as move_one_ball's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def move_one_ball(arr):
    """We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
    the following operation on the given array:
        You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.
    
    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
    position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to

assistant (to user_proxy):

I apologize for that. Let's review and correct the logic to ensure it works as expected.

The goal is to determine if an array can be sorted by performing right shift operations. The key observation here is that if the array can be sorted with right shifts, there should not be more than one "break point" where the order is disrupted, and that the elements after this break point should be less than or equal to the element before it (considering the wrap-around of the array).

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def move_one_ball(arr):
    """We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
    the following operation on the given array:
        You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.

    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
    position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

    If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
    then return True else return False.
    If the given array is empty then return True.

    Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

    For Example:
    
    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
    Explanation: By performing 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
                 be achieved for the given array.
    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
    Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given
                array by performing any number of right shift operations.
                
    """
    
    n = len(arr)
    if n < 2:
        return True

    # Find the break points in the array
    break_points = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            break_points.append(i)

    # An array can be sorted by right shifts if there is at most one break point
    return len(break_points) <= 1

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(move_one_ball)
```

This implementation should now correctly identify whether an array can be sorted by performing right shifts.
