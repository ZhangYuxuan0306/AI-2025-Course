/workspace/scenario.py:25: DeprecationWarning: `autogen.config_list_from_json(...)` is deprecated. Please use the "autogen.LLMConfig.from_json(path="OAI_CONFIG_LIST")" method instead. Scheduled for removal in 0.11.0 version.

The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `rolling_max`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `rolling_max`. However, `rolling_max` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `rolling_max` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(rolling_max)`, as well as rolling_max's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

from typing import List, Tuple


def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
    in the sequence.
    >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(rolling_max)
```
