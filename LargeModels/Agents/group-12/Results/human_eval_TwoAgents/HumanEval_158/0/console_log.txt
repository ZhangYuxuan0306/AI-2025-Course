The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `find_max`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `find_max`. However, `find_max` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `find_max` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(find_max)`, as well as find_max's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def find_max(words):
    """Write a function that accepts a list of strings.
    The list contains different words. Return the word with maximum number
    of unique characters. If multiple strings have maximum number of unique
    characters, return the one which comes first in lexicographical order.

    find_max(["name", "of", "string"]) == "string"
    find_max(["name", "enam", "game"]) == "enam"
    find_max(["aaaaaaa", "bb" ,"cc"]) == ""aaaaaaa"
    """



# Run the unit tests
