user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `prime_fib`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `prime_fib`. However, `prime_fib` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `prime_fib` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(prime_fib)`, as well as prime_fib's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def prime_fib(n: int):
    """
    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.
    >>> prime_fib(1)
    2
    >>> prime_fib(2)
    3
    >>> prime_fib(3)
    5
    >>> prime_fib(4)
    13
    >>> prime_fib(5)
    89
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(prime_fib)
```

assistant (to user_proxy):

Sure, here is the complete code block that includes importing `my_tests`, calling `run_tests(prime_fib)`, and the implementation of `prime_fib`:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def prime_fib(n: int):
    """
    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.
    >>> prime_fib(1)
    2
    >>> prime_fib(2)
    3
    >>> prime_fib(3)
    5
    >>> prime_fib(4)
    13
    >>> prime_fib(5)
    89
    """

    def is_prime(num: int) -> bool:
        if num <= 1:
            return False
        if num <= 3:
            return True
        if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
            return False
        i = 5
        while i * i <= num:
            if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
                return False
            i += 6
        return True

    def fibonacci_generator() -> int:
        a, b = 0, 1
        while True:
            yield a
            a, b = b, a + b

    count = 0
    for fib_num in fibonacci_generator():
        if is_prime(fib_num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return fib_num


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(prime_fib)
```

This code defines the `prime_fib` function, including a helper function `is_prime` to check for primality and another helper function `fibonacci_generator` to generate Fibonacci numbers. The main loop iterates over the Fibonacci sequence, counts how many prime Fibonacci numbers have been found, and returns the n-th prime Fibonacci number when it reaches the desired count.
