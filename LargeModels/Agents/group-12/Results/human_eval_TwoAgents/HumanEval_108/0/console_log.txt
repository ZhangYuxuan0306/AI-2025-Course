The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `count_nums`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `count_nums`. However, `count_nums` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `count_nums` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(count_nums)`, as well as count_nums's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def count_nums(arr):
    """
    Write a function count_nums which takes an array of integers and returns
    the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.
    If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:
    e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.
    >>> count_nums([]) == 0
    >>> count_nums([-1, 11, -11]) == 1
    >>> count_nums([1, 1, 2]) == 3
    """
