/workspace/scenario.py:25: DeprecationWarning: `autogen.config_list_from_json(...)` is deprecated. Please use the "autogen.LLMConfig.from_json(path="OAI_CONFIG_LIST")" method instead. Scheduled for removal in 0.11.0 version.

user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `intersperse`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `intersperse`. However, `intersperse` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `intersperse` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(intersperse)`, as well as intersperse's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

from typing import List


def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'
    >>> intersperse([], 4)
    []
    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(intersperse)
```
