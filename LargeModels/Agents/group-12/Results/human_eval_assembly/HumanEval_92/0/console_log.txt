The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `any_int`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `any_int`. However, `any_int` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `any_int` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(any_int)`, as well as any_int's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def any_int(x, y, z):
    '''
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    
    Examples
    any_int(5, 2, 7) ➞ True
    
    any_int(3, 2, 2) ➞ False

    any_int(3, -2, 1) ➞ True
    
    any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2) ➞ False
  

    
    '''



# Run the unit tests

### Requirements Analysis

**Key Requirements:**
- The function `any_int` should take three arguments (x, y, z).
- It must return `True` if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two.
- All input numbers must be integers.
- If any of the inputs are not integers or if no condition is met, it should return `False`.

**Input/Output Specifications:**
- **Input:** Three numbers (x, y, z).
- **Output:** Boolean value (`True` or `False`).

### Algorithm Design

**Core Algorithm Approach:**
1. Check if all three inputs are integers using the `isinstance()` function.
2. If they are integers, check if any of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two.
3. Return `True` if the condition is met; otherwise, return `False`.

**Time Complexity Analysis:**
- Checking if each number is an integer takes O(1) time.
- Checking the sum condition also takes O(1) time.
- Total time complexity: O(1).

### Implementation Strategy

1. Define the `any_int` function with appropriate type hints for clarity.
2. Use `isinstance()` to validate that all inputs are integers.
3. Implement the logic to check if any number is the sum of the other two.
4. Ensure the function returns `False` by default if the inputs are not valid.
5. Import `run_tests` from `my_tests` and call it with `any_int`.

### Key Function Design

```python
def any_int(x, y, z) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two and all numbers are integers.
    
    Args:
    x (int): First number
    y (int): Second number
    z (int): Third number
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if one number is the sum of the other two and all are integers, False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if all inputs are integers
    if not all(isinstance(i, int) for i in [x, y, z]):
        return False
    
    # Check if any number is the sum of the other two
    if x == y + z or y == x + z or z == x + y:
        return True
    
    return False
```

### Test Case Design Ideas

To ensure comprehensive testing, consider the following scenarios:
1. Valid integers where one is the sum of the other two.
2. Valid integers where no number is the sum of the other two.
3. Non-integer inputs.
4. Edge cases such as zero values.

### Full Code Block

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def any_int(x, y, z) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two and all numbers are integers.
    
    Args:
    x (int): First number
    y (int): Second number
    z (int): Third number
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if one number is the sum of the other two and all are integers, False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if all inputs are integers
    if not all(isinstance(i, int) for i in [x, y, z]):
        return False
    
    # Check if any number is the sum of the other two
    if x == y + z or y == x + z or z == x + y:
        return True
    
    return False

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(any_int)

### Code Quality Score (1-10 points)
Score: 8

#### Strengths:
1. **Functionality**: The function correctly implements the required logic to check if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two and ensures all numbers are integers.
2. **Readability**: The function has clear documentation, type hints, and follows PEP 8 style guidelines.
3. **Efficiency**: The algorithm checks conditions in constant time, making it efficient.

#### Weaknesses:
1. **Type Hinting**: While the function uses type hints, it does not specify the expected types for the inputs explicitly. For example, it could be clearer if the function expects specific types or ranges for `x`, `y`, and `z`.
2. **Error Handling**: There is no explicit error handling mechanism in place. For instance, if non-numeric types are passed, the function will still attempt to perform arithmetic operations, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
3. **Edge Cases**: The function assumes that the inputs are always numbers. While the current implementation checks for integer types, it does not handle edge cases like extremely large numbers or very small numbers that might cause issues in arithmetic operations.

### Functional Correctness
Meets requirements: Yes

#### Potential Issues:
1. **Arithmetic Operations**: Although the function checks for integer types, it performs arithmetic operations without additional checks. This could potentially lead to issues if the inputs are extremely large or very small numbers.
2. **Non-Numeric Types**: The function does not handle non-numeric types gracefully. Passing non-numeric types would result in a runtime error due to arithmetic operations.

### Improvement Suggestions
1. **Explicit Type Annotations**: Add explicit type annotations for the function parameters to make it clearer what types are expected.
   ```python
   def any_int(x: int, y: int, z: int) -> bool:
   ```

2. **Error Handling**: Add error handling to manage non-numeric types and potential overflow issues.
   ```python
   try:
       if not all(isinstance(i, int) for i in [x, y, z]):
           return False
       if x == y + z or y == x + z or z == x + y:
           return True
       return False
   except TypeError:
       return False
   ```

3. **Edge Case Testing**: Consider adding test cases to handle edge cases such as very large numbers, very small numbers, and non-numeric types.
   ```python
   assert any_int(1e9, 1e9, 2e9) == True  # Large numbers
   assert any_int(-1e9, -1e9, -2e9) == True  # Negative large numbers
   assert any_int('a', 1, 2) == False  # Non-numeric type
   ```

By addressing these suggestions, the function will be more robust and easier to maintain.

2. **Error Handling**: Added error handling to manage non-numeric types and potential overflow issues.

           return True
       return False
   except TypeError:
       return False
   ```

3. **Additional Test Cases**: Added test cases to handle edge cases such as very large numbers, very small numbers, and non-numeric types.
   ```python
   assert any_int(1e9, 1e9, 2e9) == True  # Large numbers
   assert any_int(-1e9, -1e9, -2e9) == True  # Negative large numbers
   assert any_int('a', 1, 2) == False  # Non-numeric type
   assert any_int(0, 0, 0) == True  # Zero values
   assert any_int(1, 2, 3) == False  # No number is the sum of the other two
   assert any_int(-1, -2, -3) == False  # No number is the sum of the other two
   ```

These changes improve the robustness and reliability of the `any_int` function while ensuring it handles various edge cases effectively.
