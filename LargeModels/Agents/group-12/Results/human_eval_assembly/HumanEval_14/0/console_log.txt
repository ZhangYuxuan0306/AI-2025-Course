The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `all_prefixes`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `all_prefixes`. However, `all_prefixes` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `all_prefixes` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(all_prefixes)`, as well as all_prefixes's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

from typing import List


def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(all_prefixes)
```

### Requirements Analysis

**Key requirements:**
1. The function `all_prefixes` should return a list of all prefixes of a given string.
2. Prefixes should be ordered from the shortest to the longest.
3. The function should handle empty strings gracefully by returning an empty list.
4. The function should work for any valid string input (including special characters).

**Input/output specifications:**
- **Input:** A single string (`string: str`)
- **Output:** A list of strings representing all prefixes of the input string (`List[str]`)

### Algorithm Design

**Core algorithm approach:**
1. Initialize an empty list to store the prefixes.
2. Iterate through each character in the input string up to its length.
3. For each iteration, append the substring from the start of the string to the current index to the list of prefixes.
4. Return the list of prefixes.

**Time complexity analysis:**
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. This is because slicing a string takes O(k) time, and we perform this operation n times.

### Implementation Strategy

**Step-by-step breakdown:**
1. Define the function `all_prefixes` with type annotations.
2. Initialize an empty list called `prefixes`.
3. Use a loop to iterate over the indices of the string.
4. Append each prefix to the `prefixes` list.
5. Return the `prefixes` list.

**Key function design:**
- `all_prefixes`: This function will take a string as input and return a list of all its prefixes.

### Proposed Code Block

```python
from my_tests import run_tests
from typing import List


def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """
    prefixes = []
    for i in range(len(string)):
        prefixes.append(string[:i+1])
    return prefixes


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(all_prefixes)
```

This code block includes:
- The function `all_prefixes` with the required logic.
- Importing `run_tests` from `my_tests`.
- Calling `run_tests(all_prefixes)` to execute the unit tests.

You can run this code block directly in Python to verify the correctness of the `all_prefixes` function.

### Code Quality Score (1-10 points)
Score: 8

#### Strengths:
1. **Functionality**: The `all_prefixes` function correctly implements the requirement of generating all prefixes of a given string.
2. **Readability**: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. It uses clear variable names and follows PEP 8 guidelines.
3. **Efficiency**: While the time complexity is O(n^2) due to slicing operations, it is acceptable for typical use cases.

#### Weaknesses:
1. **Docstring Example**: The docstring example provided does not match the actual implementation. The example should show the correct behavior of the function, which is `['a', 'ab', 'abc']` for the input `'abc'`.
2. **Type Hinting**: Although the function has type hints, they could be more detailed. For instance, specifying the type of the elements within the list would enhance clarity.

### Functional Correctness
Meets requirements: Yes

Potential issues: None identified.

### Improvement Suggestions
1. **Update Docstring Example**:
   ```python
   def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
       """Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
       >>> all_prefixes('abc')
       ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
       """
       prefixes = []
       for i in range(len(string)):
           prefixes.append(string[:i+1])
       return prefixes
   ```

2. **Enhance Type Hints**:
   ```python
   from my_tests import run_tests
   from typing import List, Sequence

   def all_prefixes(string: Sequence[str]) -> List[Sequence[str]]:
       """Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
       >>> all_prefixes('abc')
       ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
       """
       prefixes = []
       for i in range(len(string)):
           prefixes.append(string[:i+1])
       return prefixes
   ```

By addressing these suggestions, the code will be more robust and easier to maintain.

fixer (to chat_manager):

Thank you for the review. I'll address the suggestions to improve the code quality further. Here's the updated code block:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests
from typing import List, Sequence

def all_prefixes(string: Sequence[str]) -> List[Sequence[str]]:
    """Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """
    prefixes = []
    for i in range(len(string)):
        prefixes.append(string[:i+1])
    return prefixes


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(all_prefixes)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Enhanced Type Hints**:
   - Changed `str` to `Sequence[str]` for both the input and output parameters. This makes the function more flexible and clear about what types of sequences it can handle.

2. **Updated Docstring Example**:
   - The docstring example remains unchanged as it was already correct.

These changes ensure that the code is more robust, maintainable, and adheres to best practices in Python programming.
