The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `Strongest_Extension`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `Strongest_Extension`. However, `Strongest_Extension` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `Strongest_Extension` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(Strongest_Extension)`, as well as Strongest_Extension's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    """You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions.
    The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The
    strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase
    letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters 
    in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. 
    You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this 
    format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.
    If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should
    choose the one that comes first in the list.
    For example, if you are given "Slices" as the class and a list of the
    extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should
    return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension 
    (its strength is -1).
    Example:
    for Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']) == 'my_class.AA'

### Requirements Analysis

#### Key Requirements
1. **Class Name and Extensions**: The function `Strongest_Extension` takes two parameters: a string representing the class name and a list of strings representing the extensions.
2. **Strength Calculation**: Each extension has a strength calculated as \( \text{CAP} - \text{SM} \), where \( \text{CAP} \) is the count of uppercase letters and \( \text{SM} \) is the count of lowercase letters.
3. **Determine Strongest Extension**: Find the extension with the highest strength. If multiple extensions have the same strength, choose the first one in the list.
4. **Output Format**: Return a string in the format `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName`.

#### Input/Output Specifications
- **Input**:
  - `class_name`: A string representing the class name.
  - `extensions`: A list of strings representing the extensions.
- **Output**:
  - A string in the format `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName`.

### Algorithm Design

#### Core Algorithm Approach
1. Initialize variables to keep track of the strongest extension and its strength.
2. Iterate through each extension, calculate its strength using the formula \( \text{CAP} - \text{SM} \).
3. Compare the current extension's strength with the strongest found so far. Update the strongest extension if the current one is stronger or equal but appears earlier in the list.
4. After iterating through all extensions, return the formatted result.

#### Time Complexity Analysis
- The time complexity is \( O(n \cdot m) \), where \( n \) is the number of extensions and \( m \) is the average length of the extension names. This is because we need to iterate through each character in each extension to count the uppercase and lowercase letters.

### Implementation Strategy

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. Define the `Strongest_Extension` function.
2. Initialize variables to store the strongest extension and its strength.
3. Iterate through each extension:
   - Count the number of uppercase (`CAP`) and lowercase (`SM`) letters.
   - Calculate the strength using \( \text{CAP} - \text{SM} \).
   - Update the strongest extension if the current one is stronger or equal but appears earlier in the list.
4. Return the formatted result.

#### Key Function Design
```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest_extension = None
    max_strength = float('-inf')
    
    for ext in extensions:
        cap_count = sum(1 for char in ext if char.isupper())
        sm_count = sum(1 for char in ext if char.islower())
        strength = cap_count - sm_count
        
        if strength > max_strength or (strength == max_strength and extensions.index(ext) < extensions.index(strongest_extension)):
            strongest_extension = ext
            max_strength = strength
    
    return f"{class_name}.{strongest_extension}"
```

### Test Case Design Ideas
1. Basic Case: Check if the function correctly identifies the strongest extension.
   ```python
   assert Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']) == 'my_class.AA'
   ```
2. Mixed Strengths: Verify that the function handles extensions with different strengths.
   ```python
   assert Strongest_Extension('Slices', ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed']) == 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes'
   ```
3. Equal Strengths: Ensure that the function selects the first extension in the list when there are ties.
   ```python
   assert Strongest_Extension('Widget', ['Gizmo', 'Gadget', 'gizmo']) == 'Widget.Gizmo'
   ```
4. Edge Cases: Test with empty lists and single-element lists.
   ```python
   assert Strongest_Extension('Empty', []) == 'Empty.'
   assert Strongest_Extension('Single', ['OnlyOne']) == 'Single.OnlyOne'
   ```

### Final Code Block
```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest_extension = None
    max_strength = float('-inf')
    
    for ext in extensions:
        cap_count = sum(1 for char in ext if char.isupper())
        sm_count = sum(1 for char in ext if char.islower())
        strength = cap_count - sm_count
        
        if strength > max_strength or (strength == max_strength and extensions.index(ext) < extensions.index(strongest_extension)):
            strongest_extension = ext
            max_strength = strength
    
    return f"{class_name}.{strongest_extension}"

# Run the unit tests

```

    - extensions (list of str): A list of extension names.
    
    Returns:
    - str: The class name followed by the strongest extension name.
    """
    strongest_extension = None
    max_strength = float('-inf')
    
    for ext in extensions:
        cap_count = sum(1 for char in ext if char.isupper())
        sm_count = sum(1 for char in ext if char.islower())
        strength = cap_count - sm_count
        
        if strength > max_strength or (strength == max_strength and extensions.index(ext) < extensions.index(strongest_extension)):
            strongest_extension = ext
            max_strength = strength
    
    return f"{class_name}.{strongest_extension}"

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(Strongest_Extension)
```

### Explanation
1. **Function Definition**: The `Strongest_Extension` function takes two parameters: `class_name` and `extensions`.
2. **Initialization**: Variables `strongest_extension` and `max_strength` are initialized to keep track of the strongest extension and its strength.
3. **Iteration and Strength Calculation**: The function iterates through each extension, calculates its strength, and updates the strongest extension if the current one is stronger or equal but appears earlier in the list.
4. **Return Statement**: The function returns the formatted result in the format `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName`.
5. **Test Call**: The `run_tests(Strongest_Extension)` call ensures that the unit tests defined in `my_tests.py` are executed with the `Strongest_Extension` function.

This code block is self-contained and can be run directly in Python to verify the correctness of the `Strongest_Extension` function.

### Code Quality Score (1-10 points)
Score: 8

### Strengths:
1. **Comprehensive Documentation**: The function includes a docstring that clearly explains the purpose, parameters, and return value of the function.
2. **Efficient Implementation**: The algorithm efficiently calculates the strength of each extension and keeps track of the strongest one, resulting in a time complexity of \(O(n \cdot m)\), which is acceptable for typical input sizes.
3. **Readability**: The code is well-structured and easy to follow. It uses meaningful variable names and follows PEP 8 style guidelines.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Lack of Error Handling**: The function does not handle edge cases such as empty lists or non-string inputs gracefully. Adding error handling would make the function more robust.
2. **Inefficient String Indexing**: The use of `extensions.index(ext)` inside the loop can be inefficient, especially for large lists, as it repeatedly searches for the index of the current extension. Using an auxiliary data structure like a dictionary to map extensions to their indices could improve performance.

### Functional Correctness
Meets requirements: Yes

### Potential Issues:
1. **Edge Case Handling**: The function does not handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., empty list, non-string elements). This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors during execution.
2. **Performance**: Although the current implementation is efficient for typical use cases, it could become a bottleneck for very large lists due to repeated index lookups.

### Improvement Suggestions:
1. **Add Error Handling**: Implement checks to ensure that `class_name` is a string and `extensions` is a list of strings. Raise appropriate exceptions if these conditions are not met.
2. **Optimize Index Lookups**: Use a dictionary to map extensions to their indices, avoiding the need to repeatedly search for the index within the list.

Example of improved error handling:
```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    if not isinstance(class_name, str):
        raise ValueError("class_name must be a string")
    if not isinstance(extensions, list) or not all(isinstance(ext, str) for ext in extensions):
        raise ValueError("extensions must be a list of strings")
    
    strongest_extension = None
    max_strength = float('-inf')
    
    for ext in extensions:
        cap_count = sum(1 for char in ext if char.isupper())
        sm_count = sum(1 for char in ext if char.islower())
        strength = cap_count - sm_count
        
        if strength > max_strength or (strength == max_strength and extensions.index(ext) < extensions.index(strongest_extension)):
            strongest_extension = ext
            max_strength = strength
    
    return f"{class_name}.{strongest_extension}"
```

By addressing these suggestions, the function will be more robust and maintainable.
