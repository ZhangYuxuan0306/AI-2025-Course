The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `change_base`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `change_base`. However, `change_base` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `change_base` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(change_base)`, as well as change_base's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def change_base(x: int, base: int):
    """Change numerical base of input number x to base.
    return string representation after the conversion.
    base numbers are less than 10.
    >>> change_base(8, 3)
    '22'
    >>> change_base(8, 2)
    '1000'
    >>> change_base(7, 2)
    '111'

### Requirements Analysis

**Key Requirements:**
- Implement the `change_base` function to convert an integer `x` from its current base (default is base 10) to another specified base.
- The function should return the string representation of the converted number.
- The target base is guaranteed to be less than 10.

**Input/Output Specifications:**
- **Input:** 
  - `x`: An integer representing the number to be converted.
  - `base`: An integer representing the target base for conversion (less than 10).
- **Output:** 
  - A string representing the number `x` in the target base.

### Algorithm Design

**Core Algorithm Approach:**
- Initialize an empty list to store the digits of the converted number.
- Use a loop to repeatedly divide the number by the target base and store the remainder.
- Append each remainder to the list.
- Reverse the list to get the correct order of digits.
- Join the list into a string and return it.

**Time Complexity Analysis:**
- The time complexity is O(log_b(x)), where b is the target base and x is the input number. This is because we are dividing the number by the base repeatedly until it becomes zero.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Initialize an empty list** to store the remainders.
2. **Use a while loop** to repeatedly divide the number by the target base and append the remainder to the list.
3. **Reverse the list** to get the correct order of digits.
4. **Join the list** into a string and return it.

### Key Function Design

```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int = 10) -> str:
    if x == 0:
        return "0"
    
    digits = []
    while x > 0:
        remainder = x % base
        digits.append(str(remainder))
        x = x // base
    
    # Reverse the list and join to form the final string
    return ''.join(reversed(digits))
```

### Test Case Design Ideas

To ensure the correctness of the `change_base` function, we need to consider various scenarios such as converting positive numbers, negative numbers, and zeros. Here are some test cases:

1. **Positive Number Conversion:**
   - Convert 8 from base 10 to base 3: Expected output is `'22'`.
   - Convert 8 from base 10 to base 2: Expected output is `'1000'`.
   - Convert 7 from base 10 to base 2: Expected output is `'111'`.

2. **Zero Conversion:**
   - Convert 0 from any base: Expected output is `'0'`.

3. **Negative Number Conversion:**
   - Convert -5 from base 10 to base 2: Expected output is `'-101'`.
   - Convert -10 from base 10 to base 3: Expected output is `'-101'`.

### Final Code Block

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def change_base(x: int, base: int = 10) -> str:
    if x == 0:
        return "0"
    
    digits = []
    is_negative = x < 0
    x = abs(x)
    
    while x > 0:
        remainder = x % base
        digits.append(str(remainder))
        x = x // base
    
    if is_negative:
        digits.append('-')
    
    # Reverse the list and join to form the final string
    return ''.join(reversed(digits))

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(change_base)
```

This code block includes the complete implementation of the `change_base` function along with the necessary imports and the call to `run_tests(change_base)`. It can be executed directly in Python to validate the implementation against the provided test cases.

### Code Quality Review

**Code Quality Score:** 9

**Strengths:**

1. **Functionality**: The `change_base` function correctly converts an integer from one base to another and handles both positive and negative integers. The function uses a straightforward approach with a loop to perform the conversion.
   
2. **Documentation**: The docstring provides clear documentation of the function's purpose, parameters, and expected behavior. It also includes example usage with doctests.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the edge case where the input number `x` is zero, returning `'0'`.

4. **Readability**: The code is generally readable and follows PEP 8 guidelines, including proper indentation, spacing, and use of comments.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Error Handling**: The function does not handle invalid inputs, such as non-integer values or bases greater than or equal to 10. Adding error handling would improve robustness.

2. **Performance**: Although the time complexity is O(log_b(x)), the function could be optimized further, especially for large numbers, by using more efficient division methods or bitwise operations.

### Functional Correctness Analysis

**Meets requirements:** Yes

**Potential Issues:**

1. **Invalid Inputs**: The function does not validate the inputs to ensure they meet the specified requirements (e.g., `x` must be an integer and `base` must be less than 10).

2. **Leading Zero Handling**: The function does not handle leading zeros explicitly. For example, converting 0 to base 3 should still result in `'0'`.

### Improvement Suggestions

1. **Add Input Validation**:
   ```python
   def change_base(x: int, base: int = 10) -> str:
       if not isinstance(x, int) or not isinstance(base, int):
           raise ValueError("Both x and base must be integers.")
       if base <= 0 or base >= 10:
           raise ValueError("Base must be between 1 and 9.")
       ...
   ```

2. **Simplify Leading Zero Handling**:
   Since the function already checks if `x` is zero, leading zeros are inherently handled correctly.

3. **Optimize Division Method**:
   If performance becomes an issue, consider using bit manipulation techniques for faster division when dealing with very large numbers.

### Revised Code Block

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def change_base(x: int, base: int = 10) -> str:
    """
    Change numerical base of input number x to base.
    Return string representation after the conversion.
    Base numbers are less than 10.
    >>> change_base(8, 3)
    '22'
    >>> change_base(8, 2)
    '1000'
    >>> change_base(7, 2)
    '111'
    """
    if not isinstance(x, int) or not isinstance(base, int):
        raise ValueError("Both x and base must be integers.")
    if base <= 0 or base >= 10:
        raise ValueError("Base must be between 1 and 9.")
    
    if x == 0:
        return "0"
    
    digits = []
    is_negative = x < 0
    x = abs(x)
    
    while x > 0:
        remainder = x % base
        digits.append(str(remainder))
        x = x // base
    
    if is_negative:
        digits.append('-')
    
    # Reverse the list and join to form the final string
    return ''.join(reversed(digits))

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(change_base)
```

This revised version of the code includes input validation to ensure that the function behaves correctly under all valid conditions.

    # Reverse the list and join to form the final string
    return ''.join(reversed(digits))

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(change_base)
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Added a check to ensure that both `x` and `base` are integers.
   - Added a check to ensure that `base` is between 1 and 9 (exclusive).

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - Ensured that the function correctly handles the edge case where `x` is zero, returning `'0'`.

3. **Readability**:
   - Maintained the existing readability and structure of the code.

4. **Testing**:
   - The `run_tests(change_base)` call at the end ensures that the function is tested automatically.

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Run All Tests**:
   - Execute the entire code block to run all the unit tests associated with `change_base`.

2. **Check Output**:
   - Verify that the output matches the expected results for the given examples.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test additional edge cases such as converting negative numbers, large numbers, and boundary values (e.g., `x = 10`, `base = 9`).

By following these steps, you can ensure that the `change_base` function is thoroughly tested and meets all the specified requirements.
