The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `string_sequence`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `string_sequence`. However, `string_sequence` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `string_sequence` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(string_sequence)`, as well as string_sequence's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    """



# Run the unit tests

### Requirements Analysis

**Key Requirements:**
1. The function `string_sequence` should take an integer `n` as input.
2. It should return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to `n` inclusive.
3. The function should handle edge cases such as `n = 0`.

**Input/Output Specifications:**
- **Input:** An integer `n`.
- **Output:** A string with space-separated numbers from 0 to `n`.

### Algorithm Design

**Core Algorithm Approach:**
1. Initialize an empty list to store the numbers from 0 to `n`.
2. Use a loop to iterate from 0 to `n`, appending each number to the list.
3. Convert the list of numbers to a string using `' '.join()`.
4. Return the resulting string.

**Time Complexity Analysis:**
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where `n` is the input integer. This is because we need to iterate through all numbers from 0 to `n` once.

### Implementation Strategy

**Step-by-step Breakdown:**
1. Define the function `string_sequence` with the signature `def string_sequence(n: int) -> str`.
2. Initialize an empty list called `numbers`.
3. Use a for loop to iterate from 0 to `n`, appending each number to the `numbers` list.
4. Convert the `numbers` list to a string using `' '.join(numbers)`.
5. Return the resulting string.

**Key Function Design:**
- `string_sequence`: This function takes an integer `n` and returns a string with space-separated numbers from 0 to `n`.

### Proposed Test Case Design Ideas

To ensure the correctness of the implementation, we should consider the following test cases:
1. `string_sequence(0)` should return `'0'`.
2. `string_sequence(5)` should return `'0 1 2 3 4 5'`.
3. `string_sequence(-1)` should return an empty string `''`.
4. `string_sequence(10)` should return `'0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10'`.

### Final Code Block

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    """
    if n < 0:
        return ''
    
    numbers = []
    for i in range(n + 1):
        numbers.append(str(i))
    
    return ' '.join(numbers)

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(string_sequence)
```

This code block includes the complete implementation of `string_sequence`, the necessary import statement, and the call to `run_tests(string_sequence)` to execute the automated unit tests.

Here is the complete code block that includes the implementation of `string_sequence`, the import statement for `run_tests`, and the call to `run_tests(string_sequence)`:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    """
    if n < 0:
        return ''
    
    numbers = []
    for i in range(n + 1):
        numbers.append(str(i))
    
    return ' '.join(numbers)

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(string_sequence)
```

This code is fully self-contained and ready to be executed directly in Python. It defines the `string_sequence` function according to the specified requirements and handles edge cases appropriately. The `run_tests(string_sequence)` call will execute the automated unit tests to verify the correctness of the implementation.

### Code Review Results

#### Code Quality Score (1-10 points)
Score: 8

##### Strengths:
1. **Functionality**: The `string_sequence` function correctly generates a space-delimited string of numbers from 0 to `n`, including edge cases like negative inputs.
2. **Readability**: The code is well-structured and follows PEP 8 guidelines. Variable names are descriptive, and the logic is easy to follow.
3. **Efficiency**: The implementation uses a simple loop to generate the sequence, which has a linear time complexity of O(n). This is efficient for typical use cases.

##### Weaknesses:
1. **Docstring**: While the docstring provides examples, it lacks a formal description of the function's purpose and parameters. Adding a brief description would improve clarity.
2. **Edge Cases**: Although the function handles negative inputs by returning an empty string, it could benefit from additional checks or documentation to clarify how it handles other edge cases (e.g., very large values of `n`).

#### Functional Correctness
Meets requirements: Yes

##### Potential Issues:
1. **Performance**: For extremely large values of `n`, the current implementation may consume significant memory due to the creation of a large list. Consider optimizing memory usage if performance becomes an issue.
2. **Documentation**: The lack of a detailed docstring makes it harder for other developers to understand the function's behavior without reading the code.

#### Improvement Suggestions
1. **Enhanced Docstring**: Add a more detailed description of the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.
   ```python
   def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
       """ Generate a space-delimited string of numbers from 0 to n inclusive.
       
       Parameters:
       n (int): The upper limit of the number sequence.
       
       Returns:
       str: A string containing space-delimited numbers from 0 to n.
       
       Examples:
       >>> string_sequence(0)
       '0'
       >>> string_sequence(5)
       '0 1 2 3 4 5'
       """
       if n < 0:
           return ''
       
       numbers = []
       for i in range(n + 1):
           numbers.append(str(i))
       
       return ' '.join(numbers)
   ```

2. **Memory Optimization**: If performance becomes an issue for very large values of `n`, consider using a generator instead of a list to reduce memory usage.
   ```python
   def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
       """ Generate a space-delimited string of numbers from 0 to n inclusive.
       
       Parameters:
       n (int): The upper limit of the number sequence.
       
       Returns:
       str: A string containing space-delimited numbers from 0 to n.
       
       Examples:
       >>> string_sequence(0)
       '0'
       >>> string_sequence(5)
       '0 1 2 3 4 5'
       """
       if n < 0:
           return ''
       
       return ' '.join(str(i) for i in range(n + 1))
   ```

By addressing these suggestions, the code can become even more robust and maintainable.
