The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `greatest_common_divisor`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `greatest_common_divisor`. However, `greatest_common_divisor` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `greatest_common_divisor` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(greatest_common_divisor)`, as well as greatest_common_divisor's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """ Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
    1
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
    5

### Requirements Analysis

**Key Requirements**
1. The `greatest_common_divisor` function must compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.
2. The function should handle both positive and negative integers.
3. The function should return the GCD of the absolute values of the input integers.

**Input/Output Specifications**
- **Input:** Two integers `a` and `b`.
- **Output:** An integer representing the GCD of `a` and `b`.

### Algorithm Design

**Core Algorithm Approach**
To compute the GCD of two numbers, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm proceeds as follows:
1. If `b` is 0, then `a` is the GCD.
2. Otherwise, recursively call the function with `b` and `a % b`.

**Time Complexity Analysis**
The time complexity of the Euclidean algorithm is \(O(\log \min(a, b))\), which is efficient for typical integer inputs.

### Implementation Strategy

1. Define the `greatest_common_divisor` function using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. Ensure the function handles both positive and negative integers by taking the absolute value of the inputs.
3. Import the `run_tests` function from `my_tests.py`.
4. Call `run_tests(greatest_common_divisor)` to execute the unit tests.

### Key Function Design

```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Return the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b"""
    a, b = abs(a), abs(b)  # Handle negative integers by taking absolute values
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

### Test Case Design Ideas

To ensure comprehensive testing, consider the following scenarios:
1. Positive integers.
2. Negative integers.
3. Zero.
4. One of the numbers being zero.
5. Large numbers.
6. Prime numbers.

Here are some example test cases:

```python
def test_greatest_common_divisor():
    assert greatest_common_divisor(3, 5) == 1
    assert greatest_common_divisor(25, 15) == 5
    assert greatest_common_divisor(-3, -5) == 1
    assert greatest_common_divisor(-25, 15) == 5
    assert greatest_common_divisor(0, 5) == 5
    assert greatest_common_divisor(25, 0) == 25
    assert greatest_common_divisor(0, 0) == 0
    assert greatest_common_divisor(7, 13) == 1
    assert greatest_common_divisor(100, 25) == 25
    assert greatest_common_divisor(18, 24) == 6
    assert greatest_common_divisor(1000000, 999999) == 1
```

### Final Code Block

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Return the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b"""
    a, b = abs(a), abs(b)  # Handle negative integers by taking absolute values
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(greatest_common_divisor)

# Example test cases
test_greatest_common_divisor()
```

This code block includes the complete implementation of the `greatest_common_divisor` function, along with the necessary imports and test calls. It can be executed directly in Python to verify its correctness.

engineer (to chat_manager):

Certainly! Below is the complete code block that includes the implementation of the `greatest_common_divisor` function, the necessary imports, and the call to `run_tests(greatest_common_divisor)`.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Return the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b"""
    a, b = abs(a), abs(b)  # Handle negative integers by taking absolute values
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(greatest_common_divisor)
```

This code can be executed directly in Python to run the automated unit tests and verify the correctness of the `greatest_common_divisor` function.

### Code Review Results

#### Code Quality Score (1-10 points)
Score: 8

**Strengths:**
1. **Correct Implementation**: The `greatest_common_divisor` function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.
2. **Handling Negative Numbers**: The function converts both inputs to their absolute values, ensuring it works correctly for negative numbers.
3. **Efficiency**: The implementation has a time complexity of \(O(\log \min(a, b))\), making it efficient.
4. **Docstring**: The function includes a docstring with examples, which aids in understanding and documentation.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Test Coverage**: While the provided test cases cover several scenarios, they might not be exhaustive. Additional edge cases could be added.
2. **Code Readability**: The variable names (`a`, `b`) could be more descriptive to improve readability.

#### Functional Correctness
Meets requirements: Yes

**Potential Issues:**
1. **Edge Cases**: There might be edge cases not covered by the current test cases, such as very large numbers or specific patterns in input values.
2. **Type Checking**: Although the function specifies type hints, explicit type checking within the function would add robustness.

#### Improvement Suggestions
1. **Enhanced Test Cases**: Add more test cases to cover additional edge scenarios, such as very large numbers, small numbers, and prime numbers.
2. **Descriptive Variable Names**: Consider renaming variables like `a` and `b` to more descriptive names like `num1` and `num2` to improve readability.
3. **Type Checking**: Implement type checking to ensure that the inputs are indeed integers.

### Final Recommendation

The provided code meets the functional requirements but could benefit from enhanced test coverage, more descriptive variable names, and explicit type checking. These improvements will enhance the reliability and maintainability of the code.

    """
    num1, num2 = abs(num1), abs(num2)  # Handle negative integers by taking absolute values
    while num2 != 0:
        num1, num2 = num2, num1 % num2
