            "content": "### Requirements Analysis\n\n**Key Requirements:**\n1. The function `intersperse` should insert a specified delimiter between every two consecutive elements of a given list of integers.\n2. The function should handle both empty lists and non-empty lists.\n3. The function should return a new list with the delimiter inserted.\n\n**Input/Output Specifications:**\n- **Input:** A list of integers (`numbers`) and an integer (`delimiter`).\n- **Output:** A list of integers where the delimiter is inserted between every two consecutive elements of the input list.\n\n### Algorithm Design\n\n**Core Algorithm Approach:**\n1. Check if the input list `numbers` is empty. If it is, return an empty list.\n2. Initialize an empty result list.\n3. Iterate through the input list `numbers`.\n   - For each element except the last one, append the element and the delimiter to the result list.\n   - Append the last element to the result list without adding the delimiter after it.\n4. Return the result list.\n\n**Time Complexity Analysis:**\n- The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input list `numbers`. This is because we iterate through the list once.\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n\n**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n1. Define the `intersperse` function.\n2. Handle the base case where the input list is empty.\n3. Initialize an empty list to store the result.\n4. Iterate through the input list, appending elements and delimiters to the result list.\n5. Return the result list.\n\n**Key Function Design:**\n- `intersperse`: This function takes a list of integers and a delimiter, and returns a new list with the delimiter inserted between every two consecutive elements.\n\n### Code Block\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimiter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers' \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        result.append(numbers[i])\n        if i < len(numbers) - 1:\n            result.append(delimiter)\n\n    return result\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(intersperse)\n```\n\nThis code block includes the complete implementation of the `intersperse` function, along with the necessary imports and the call to `run_tests(intersperse)` to execute the automated unit tests.",
