The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `intersperse`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `intersperse`. However, `intersperse` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `intersperse` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(intersperse)`, as well as intersperse's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

from typing import List


def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'
    >>> intersperse([], 4)
    []
    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
    """



# Run the unit tests

### Requirements Analysis

**Key Requirements:**
1. The function `intersperse` should insert a specified delimiter between every two consecutive elements of a given list of integers.
2. The function should handle both empty lists and non-empty lists.
3. The function should return a new list with the delimiter inserted.

**Input/Output Specifications:**
- **Input:** A list of integers (`numbers`) and an integer (`delimiter`).
- **Output:** A list of integers where the delimiter is inserted between every two consecutive elements of the input list.

### Algorithm Design

**Core Algorithm Approach:**
1. Check if the input list `numbers` is empty. If it is, return an empty list.
2. Initialize an empty result list.
3. Iterate through the input list `numbers`.
   - For each element except the last one, append the element and the delimiter to the result list.
   - Append the last element to the result list without adding the delimiter after it.
4. Return the result list.

**Time Complexity Analysis:**
- The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input list `numbers`. This is because we iterate through the list once.

### Implementation Strategy

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
1. Define the `intersperse` function.
2. Handle the base case where the input list is empty.
3. Initialize an empty list to store the result.
4. Iterate through the input list, appending elements and delimiters to the result list.
5. Return the result list.

**Key Function Design:**
- `intersperse`: This function takes a list of integers and a delimiter, and returns a new list with the delimiter inserted between every two consecutive elements.

### Code Block

```python
from my_tests import run_tests
from typing import List


def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Insert a number 'delimiter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers' """
    if not numbers:
        return []

    result = []
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        result.append(numbers[i])
        if i < len(numbers) - 1:
            result.append(delimiter)

    return result


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(intersperse)
```

This code block includes the complete implementation of the `intersperse` function, along with the necessary imports and the call to `run_tests(intersperse)` to execute the automated unit tests.

Here is the complete code block that includes the implementation of the `intersperse` function, the necessary imports, and the call to `run_tests(intersperse)` to execute the automated unit tests:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests
from typing import List


def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Insert a number 'delimiter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers' """
    if not numbers:
        return []

    result = []
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        result.append(numbers[i])
        if i < len(numbers) - 1:
            result.append(delimiter)

    return result


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(intersperse)
```

This code ensures that the `intersperse` function works correctly by inserting the specified delimiter between every two consecutive elements of the input list. It also handles the edge case of an empty input list by returning an empty list. The provided test cases in `my_tests.py` will validate the correctness of this implementation.

### Code Quality Review

**Code Quality Score: 8/10**

#### Strengths:
1. **Functionality**: The `intersperse` function correctly inserts a delimiter between every two consecutive elements of the input list. It also handles the edge case of an empty list effectively.
2. **Readability**: The code is well-structured with clear variable names and comments explaining the purpose of each part.
3. **Efficiency**: The time complexity of the function is O(n), which is efficient for this type of problem.

#### Weaknesses:
1. **Docstring Completeness**: While the docstring provides a brief description of the function, it lacks examples or more detailed explanations, which could help users understand the expected behavior better.
2. **Type Annotations**: Although type annotations are used, they do not cover all parameters and return types. Adding type hints for all parameters and the return type would improve clarity and catch potential type-related errors during development.

### Functional Correctness

**Meets requirements: Yes**

**Potential Issues:**
1. No runtime exceptions are raised under normal conditions.
2. The function behaves as expected for various inputs, including edge cases like an empty list.

### Improvement Suggestions

1. **Enhance Docstring**: Add more detailed examples and explanations in the docstring to make it easier for users to understand how the function should be used.
2. **Add Type Hints**: Include type hints for all parameters and the return type to ensure consistency and reduce potential bugs related to incorrect data types.

### Final Code Block

```python
from my_tests import run_tests
from typing import List


def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Insert a number 'delimiter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'

    Parameters:
    numbers (List[int]): The list of integers to process.
    delimiter (int): The integer to insert between elements.

    Returns:
    List[int]: A new list with the delimiter inserted between every two consecutive elements.

    Examples:
    >>> intersperse([], 4)
    []
    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
    """
    if not numbers:
        return []

    result = []
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        result.append(numbers[i])
        if i < len(numbers) - 1:
            result.append(delimiter)

    return result


# Run the unit tests
