user_proxy (to chat_manager):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `is_equal_to_sum_even`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `is_equal_to_sum_even`. However, `is_equal_to_sum_even` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `is_equal_to_sum_even` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(is_equal_to_sum_even)`, as well as is_equal_to_sum_even's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers
    Example
    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(is_equal_to_sum_even)

### Requirements Analysis

#### Key Requirements:
1. The function `is_equal_to_sum_even` should determine if a given integer `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even integers.
2. The function must return `True` if such a representation exists; otherwise, it should return `False`.

#### Input/Output Specifications:
- **Input**: An integer `n`.
- **Output**: A boolean value (`True` or `False`).

### Algorithm Design

#### Core Algorithm Approach:
To solve this problem, we need to check if `n` can be represented as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. 

Since the smallest even number is 2, the smallest possible sum of four even numbers is \(2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8\). Therefore, any number less than 8 cannot be represented as the sum of four positive even numbers.

For numbers greater than or equal to 8, we can always find four even numbers that sum up to `n`. For example, for `n = 8`, we can use [2, 2, 2, 2]. For `n = 10`, we can use [2, 2, 2, 4], and so on.

Thus, the function can be implemented by checking if `n` is at least 8.

#### Time Complexity Analysis:
- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\), as it involves a simple comparison.

### Implementation Strategy

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. Import the `run_tests` function from `my_tests`.
2. Define the `is_equal_to_sum_even` function.
3. Implement the logic inside `is_equal_to_sum_even` to check if `n` is at least 8.
4. Call `run_tests(is_equal_to_sum_even)` to execute the unit tests.

#### Key Function Design:
- The `is_equal_to_sum_even` function will take an integer `n` as input and return `True` if `n >= 8`, otherwise `False`.

### Proposed Code Block

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers
    Example
    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True
    """
    return n >= 8


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(is_equal_to_sum_even)
```

This code block includes the complete implementation of `is_equal_to_sum_even`, along with the necessary imports and test call, ensuring that it can be run directly in Python to validate the function's correctness.

### Code Quality Review

**Code Quality Score:** 8/10

**Strengths:**
1. **Functionality:** The function `is_equal_to_sum_even` correctly checks if a number `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers.
2. **Readability:** The function has a clear docstring explaining its purpose and examples.
3. **Efficiency:** The implementation is efficient with a time complexity of \(O(1)\).
4. **Comprehensiveness:** The provided code block is self-contained and ready to be executed.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Lack of Edge Case Handling:** While the current implementation handles the basic requirement, there is no explicit handling for edge cases like negative numbers or non-integer inputs.
2. **Documentation:** Although the docstring provides examples, it could benefit from more detailed explanations or additional examples to cover all potential scenarios.

### Functional Correctness

**Meets requirements:** Yes

**Potential issues:**
1. **Negative Numbers:** The function does not handle negative numbers. It should return `False` for negative inputs since they cannot be expressed as the sum of positive even numbers.
2. **Non-Integer Inputs:** The function does not handle non-integer inputs. It should raise a `TypeError` or handle them appropriately.

### Improvement Suggestions

1. **Handle Negative Numbers:**
   Add a check to ensure that the input `n` is not negative. If `n` is negative, return `False`.

2. **Handle Non-Integer Inputs:**
   Add a check to ensure that the input `n` is an integer. If `n` is not an integer, raise a `TypeError`.

3. **Enhance Documentation:**
   Expand the docstring to include more detailed examples and explain the behavior for edge cases.

### Updated Code Block

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number to evaluate.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers, False otherwise.
    
    Examples:
    >>> is_equal_to_sum_even(4)
    False
    >>> is_equal_to_sum_even(6)
    False
    >>> is_equal_to_sum_even(8)
    True
    >>> is_equal_to_sum_even(-2)
    False
    >>> is_equal_to_sum_even(7.5)
    TypeError: Input must be an integer
    """
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        raise TypeError("Input must be an integer")
    if n < 8:
        return False
    return True


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(is_equal_to_sum_even)
```

This updated code block includes additional checks for negative numbers and non-integer inputs, enhances the documentation, and ensures the function behaves correctly under various edge cases.

### Code Quality Review

**Code Quality Score:** 9/10

**Strengths:**
1. **Functionality:** The function `is_equal_to_sum_even` now correctly checks if a number `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers, including handling negative numbers and non-integer inputs.
2. **Readability:** The function has a clear docstring with detailed explanations and examples.
3. **Efficiency:** The implementation remains efficient with a time complexity of \(O(1)\).
4. **Comprehensiveness:** The provided code block is self-contained and ready to be executed.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Edge Case Handling:** While the current implementation handles negative numbers and non-integer inputs, there is still room for further refinement in the error message for non-integer inputs.

### Functional Correctness

**Meets requirements:** Yes

**Potential issues:**
1. **Error Message:** The error message for non-integer inputs could be more descriptive. Instead of raising a generic `TypeError`, it could specify that the input must be an integer.

### Improvement Suggestions

1. **Refine Error Message:**
   Improve the error message for non-integer inputs to provide clearer instructions.
