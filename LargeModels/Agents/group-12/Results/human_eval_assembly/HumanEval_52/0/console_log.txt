The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `below_threshold`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `below_threshold`. However, `below_threshold` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `below_threshold` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(below_threshold)`, as well as below_threshold's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def below_threshold(l: list, t: int):
    """Return True if all numbers in the list l are below threshold t.
    >>> below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100)
    True
    >>> below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5)
    False
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(below_threshold)
```

### Requirements Analysis

**Key Requirements:**
- The function `below_threshold` should return `True` if all elements in the list `l` are below the given threshold `t`.
- The function should return `False` otherwise.
- The function should handle empty lists correctly by returning `True`.

**Input/Output Specifications:**
- **Input:** A list of integers `l` and an integer `t`.
- **Output:** A boolean value indicating whether all elements in the list are below the threshold.

### Algorithm Design

**Core Algorithm Approach:**
1. Iterate through each element in the list `l`.
2. Check if the current element is less than the threshold `t`.
3. If any element is not below the threshold, return `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any element above the threshold, return `True`.

**Time Complexity Analysis:**
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list `l`. This is because we need to check each element once.

### Implementation Strategy

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
1. Import the `run_tests` function from `my_tests`.
2. Define the `below_threshold` function with appropriate type hints.
3. Implement the logic inside the `below_threshold` function to check if all elements in the list are below the threshold.
4. Call `run_tests(below_threshold)` to execute the unit tests.

**Key Function Design:**
- `below_threshold(l: List[int], t: int) -> bool`

### Proposed Code Block

```python
from typing import List
from my_tests import run_tests


def below_threshold(l: List[int], t: int) -> bool:
    """Return True if all numbers in the list l are below threshold t."""
    for num in l:
        if num >= t:
            return False
    return True


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(below_threshold)
```

### Test Case Design Ideas

To ensure the correctness of the `below_threshold` function, consider the following test cases:

1. **Empty List:**
   - Input: `[], 10`
   - Expected Output: `True`

2. **All Elements Below Threshold:**
   - Input: `[1, 2, 4, 9], 10`
   - Expected Output: `True`

3. **One Element Above Threshold:**
   - Input: `[1, 20, 4, 10], 5`
   - Expected Output: `False`

4. **All Elements Equal to Threshold:**
   - Input: `[5, 5, 5], 5`
   - Expected Output: `False`

5. **Negative Numbers Below Threshold:**
   - Input: `[-1, -2, -4, -10], 0`
   - Expected Output: `True`

6. **Mixed Positive and Negative Numbers:**
   - Input: `[1, -2, 4, -10], 2`
   - Expected Output: `False`

By running these test cases, you can validate that the `below_threshold` function behaves as expected under various conditions.

def below_threshold(l: List[int], t: int) -> bool:
    """Return True if all numbers in the list l are below threshold t."""
    for num in l:
        if num >= t:
            return False
    return True


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(below_threshold)
```

This code block can be run directly in Python to verify the implementation of the `below_threshold` function using the provided unit tests.

### Code Quality Score (1-10 points)
Score: 8

#### Strengths:
1. **Type Hints**: The use of type hints (`List[int]` and `bool`) improves code readability and helps catch type-related errors during development.
2. **Function Documentation**: The docstring clearly describes what the function does, its parameters, and its return value, which aids in understanding and maintaining the code.
3. **Loop Optimization**: The implementation uses a simple loop to check each element, which is efficient and straightforward.
4. **Boundary Case Handling**: The function handles the boundary case of an empty list by returning `True`, which is correct according to the problem description.

#### Weaknesses:
1. **Readability**: While the code is functional, it could benefit from additional comments or breaking down complex logic into smaller functions to improve readability further.
2. **Error Handling**: There is no error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-list types for `l` or non-integer types for `t`). Adding robust error handling would make the function more robust.
3. **Test Coverage**: Although the provided code block includes a call to `run_tests(below_threshold)`, the actual test cases within `my_tests.py` are not included in the provided snippet. Ensuring thorough test coverage is crucial for verifying the correctness of the function.

### Functional Correctness
Meets requirements: Yes

The provided code meets the requirements specified in the problem statement. It correctly checks if all elements in the list are below the given threshold and returns `True` or `False` accordingly. The function also handles the edge case of an empty list correctly.

### Potential Issues
1. **Lack of Error Handling**: The function does not include error handling for invalid inputs. For example, passing a non-list type for `l` or a non-integer type for `t` would cause runtime errors.
2. **Incomplete Test Cases**: The provided code block calls `run_tests(below_threshold)`, but the actual test cases within `my_tests.py` are not included. Ensure that the test cases cover various scenarios, including edge cases and error handling.

### Improvement Suggestions
1. **Add Error Handling**: Include error handling to ensure that the function raises meaningful exceptions when passed invalid inputs.
   ```python
   def below_threshold(l: List[int], t: int) -> bool:
       if not isinstance(l, list) or not all(isinstance(x, int) for x in l):
           raise ValueError("First argument must be a list of integers")
       if not isinstance(t, int):
           raise ValueError("Second argument must be an integer")
       for num in l:
           if num >= t:
               return False
       return True
   ```

2. **Include Test Cases**: Ensure that the test cases within `my_tests.py` cover various scenarios, including edge cases and error handling. Here is an example of how you might structure your test cases:
   ```python
   def test_below_threshold():
       assert below_threshold([], 10) == True
       assert below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 9], 10) == True
       assert below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5) == False
       assert below_threshold([5, 5, 5], 5) == False
       assert below_threshold([-1, -2, -4, -10], 0) == True
       assert below_threshold([1, -2, 4, -10], 2) == False
       try:
           below_threshold("not a list", 10)
           assert False, "Expected a TypeError"
       except TypeError:
           pass
       try:
           below_threshold([1, 2, 3], "not an integer")
           assert False, "Expected a TypeError"
       except TypeError:
           pass
   ```

3. **Code Comments**: Add comments to explain the purpose of the code blocks, especially for more complex logic or decisions made within the function.

By addressing these suggestions, you can enhance the robustness and maintainability of the code.

    # Iterate through each element in the list
    for num in l:
        if num >= t:
            return False
    
    # If all elements are below the threshold, return True
    return True


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(below_threshold)
```

### Explanation of Improvements

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Added checks to ensure that `l` is a list and contains only integers.
   - Added a check to ensure that `t` is an integer.
