The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `is_happy`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `is_happy`. However, `is_happy` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `is_happy` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(is_happy)`, as well as is_happy's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def is_happy(s):
    """You are given a string s.
    Your task is to check if the string is happy or not.
    A string is happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct
    For example:
    is_happy(a) => False
    is_happy(aa) => False
    is_happy(abcd) => True
    is_happy(aabb) => False
    is_happy(adb) => True
    is_happy(xyy) => False
    """



# Run the unit tests

### Requirements Analysis

**Key Requirements:**
1. The function `is_happy` must check if a given string `s` meets specific conditions.
2. The string is considered "happy" if its length is at least 3 and every three consecutive characters are distinct.
3. The function should return `True` if the string is happy, otherwise `False`.

**Input/Output Specifications:**
- **Input:** A single string `s`.
- **Output:** A boolean value (`True` if the string is happy, `False` otherwise).

### Algorithm Design

**Core Algorithm Approach:**
1. Check if the length of the string `s` is less than 3. If so, return `False`.
2. Iterate through the string using a loop, checking each triplet of consecutive characters.
3. For each triplet, ensure that all three characters are distinct.
4. If any triplet does not meet the distinctness condition, return `False`.
5. If all triplets meet the distinctness condition, return `True`.

**Time Complexity Analysis:**
- The algorithm iterates through the string once, checking each character in a triplet.
- Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string.

### Implementation Strategy

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
1. Import the `run_tests` function from `my_tests`.
2. Define the `is_happy` function with appropriate documentation.
3. Implement the logic to check if the string length is less than 3.
4. Iterate through the string in steps of 3 and check for distinct characters.
5. Call `run_tests(is_happy)` to execute the unit tests.

**Key Function Design:**
- `is_happy(s)`: This function will contain the logic described above.

### Proposed Test Case Design Ideas

To thoroughly test the `is_happy` function, consider the following test cases:

1. Empty string: Should return `False`.
2. String with length less than 3: Should return `False`.
3. String with all distinct characters: Should return `True`.
4. String with repeating characters: Should return `False`.
5. String with mixed characters: Should return `True` or `False` based on the distinctness of each triplet.

### Final Code Block

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def is_happy(s):
    """
    Check if the string s is happy.
    A string is happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct.
    
    :param s: Input string
    :return: Boolean indicating whether the string is happy
    """
    # Check if the length of the string is less than 3
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    
    # Iterate through the string in steps of 3
    for i in range(len(s) - 2):
        # Extract the current triplet
        triplet = s[i:i+3]
        
        # Check if all characters in the triplet are distinct
        if len(set(triplet)) != 3:
            return False
    
    # If all triplets are distinct, the string is happy
    return True


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(is_happy)
```

This code block includes the complete implementation of the `is_happy` function, along with the necessary imports and test invocation. It adheres to the requirements and provides a comprehensive solution to the problem.
