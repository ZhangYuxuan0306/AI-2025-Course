            "content": "### Requirements Analysis\n\n**Key Requirements:**\n1. The function `is_happy` must check if a given string `s` meets specific conditions.\n2. The string is considered \"happy\" if its length is at least 3 and every three consecutive characters are distinct.\n3. The function should return `True` if the string is happy, otherwise `False`.\n\n**Input/Output Specifications:**\n- **Input:** A single string `s`.\n- **Output:** A boolean value (`True` if the string is happy, `False` otherwise).\n\n### Algorithm Design\n\n**Core Algorithm Approach:**\n1. Check if the length of the string `s` is less than 3. If so, return `False`.\n2. Iterate through the string using a loop, checking each triplet of consecutive characters.\n3. For each triplet, ensure that all three characters are distinct.\n4. If any triplet does not meet the distinctness condition, return `False`.\n5. If all triplets meet the distinctness condition, return `True`.\n\n**Time Complexity Analysis:**\n- The algorithm iterates through the string once, checking each character in a triplet.\n- Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string.\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n\n**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n1. Import the `run_tests` function from `my_tests`.\n2. Define the `is_happy` function with appropriate documentation.\n3. Implement the logic to check if the string length is less than 3.\n4. Iterate through the string in steps of 3 and check for distinct characters.\n5. Call `run_tests(is_happy)` to execute the unit tests.\n\n**Key Function Design:**\n- `is_happy(s)`: This function will contain the logic described above.\n\n### Proposed Test Case Design Ideas\n\nTo thoroughly test the `is_happy` function, consider the following test cases:\n\n1. Empty string: Should return `False`.\n2. String with length less than 3: Should return `False`.\n3. String with all distinct characters: Should return `True`.\n4. String with repeating characters: Should return `False`.\n5. String with mixed characters: Should return `True` or `False` based on the distinctness of each triplet.\n\n### Final Code Block\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef is_happy(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if the string s is happy.\n    A string is happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct.\n    \n    :param s: Input string\n    :return: Boolean indicating whether the string is happy\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the length of the string is less than 3\n    if len(s) < 3:\n        return False\n    \n    # Iterate through the string in steps of 3\n    for i in range(len(s) - 2):\n        # Extract the current triplet\n        triplet = s[i:i+3]\n        \n        # Check if all characters in the triplet are distinct\n        if len(set(triplet)) != 3:\n            return False\n    \n    # If all triplets are distinct, the string is happy\n    return True\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(is_happy)\n```\n\nThis code block includes the complete implementation of the `is_happy` function, along with the necessary imports and test invocation.
