The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `remove_vowels`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `remove_vowels`. However, `remove_vowels` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `remove_vowels` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(remove_vowels)`, as well as remove_vowels's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def remove_vowels(text):
    """
    remove_vowels is a function that takes string and returns string without vowels.
    >>> remove_vowels('')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")
    'bcdf\nghjklm'
    >>> remove_vowels('abcdef')
    'bcdf'
    >>> remove_vowels('aaaaa')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels('aaBAA')
    'B'
    >>> remove_vowels('zbcd')

### Requirements Analysis

**Key requirements:**
1. The `remove_vowels` function should take a string as input and return a string with all vowels removed.
2. Vowels include both uppercase ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U') and lowercase ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').
3. The function must handle multiline strings correctly, preserving line breaks.
4. The function must preserve non-alphabetic characters (spaces, punctuation, etc.).

**Input/output specifications:**
- **Input:** A string.
- **Output:** A string with all vowels removed.

### Algorithm Design

**Core algorithm approach:**
1. Iterate through each character in the input string.
2. Check if the character is a vowel.
3. If it is not a vowel, append it to the result string.
4. Return the result string after processing all characters.

**Time complexity analysis:**
- The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we need to iterate through each character once.

### Implementation Strategy

**Step-by-step breakdown:**
1. Define the `remove_vowels` function.
2. Initialize an empty list to store non-vowel characters.
3. Iterate through each character in the input string:
   - Convert the character to lowercase to simplify the check for vowels.
   - Check if the character is not a vowel using a set of vowels.
   - If it is not a vowel, append it to the list.
4. Join the list into a string and return it.

**Key function design:**
- `remove_vowels`: Takes a string and returns a string with all vowels removed.

### Code Implementation

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def remove_vowels(text):
    """
    remove_vowels is a function that takes string and returns string without vowels.
    >>> remove_vowels('')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")
    'bcdf\nghjklm'
    >>> remove_vowels('abcdef')
    'bcdf'
    >>> remove_vowels('aaaaa')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels('aaBAA')
    'B'
    >>> remove_vowels('zbcd')
    'zbcd'
    """
    vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
    result = []
    
    for char in text:
        if char.lower() not in vowels:
            result.append(char)
    
    return ''.join(result)

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(remove_vowels)
```

### Test Case Design Ideas

To ensure comprehensive testing, consider the following scenarios:
1. Empty string (`''`)
2. String with no vowels (`'zbcd'`)
3. String with only vowels (`'aaaaa'`)
4. String with mixed characters (`'abcde'`)
5. String with uppercase vowels (`'aaBAA'`)
6. Multiline string with vowels (`"abcdef\nghijklm"`)

These test cases cover various edge cases and typical use cases for the `remove_vowels` function.

engineer (to chat_manager):

Here is the complete Python code block that includes the implementation of `remove_vowels`, the import statement for `run_tests`, and the call to `run_tests(remove_vowels)`. This code can be run directly in Python to execute the tests.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def remove_vowels(text):
    """
    remove_vowels is a function that takes a string and returns a string without vowels.
    >>> remove_vowels('')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")
    'bcdf\nghjklm'
    >>> remove_vowels('abcdef')
    'bcdf'
    >>> remove_vowels('aaaaa')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels('aaBAA')
    'B'
    >>> remove_vowels('zbcd')
    'zbcd'
    """
    vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
    result = []
    
    for char in text:
        if char.lower() not in vowels:
            result.append(char)
    
    return ''.join(result)

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(remove_vowels)
```

This code defines the `remove_vowels` function, which iterates through each character in the input string, checks if it is a vowel, and appends it to the result if it is not. The function handles multiline strings and preserves non-alphabetic characters. The `run_tests(remove_vowels)` call at the end executes the automated unit tests to verify the correctness of the implementation.

### Code Quality Review

**Code Quality Score (1-10 points):**
Score: 8

**Strengths:**
1. **Functionality**: The `remove_vowels` function correctly removes vowels from the input string while preserving other characters, including line breaks.
2. **Readability**: The code is well-structured with clear variable names and comments explaining the purpose of each part.
3. **Efficiency**: The time complexity of the function is O(n), which is efficient for its purpose.
4. **Documentation**: The docstring provides examples and descriptions, making it easy to understand the expected behavior.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Case Sensitivity**: Although the function converts characters to lowercase before checking, it might be better to make this explicit in the documentation or comments for clarity.
2. **Error Handling**: There is no error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-string types. Adding type checking could improve robustness.

### Functional Correctness Analysis

**Meets requirements: Yes**

**Potential issues:**
1. **Type Checking**: The function does not check if the input is a string. Adding a type check would prevent unexpected errors when non-string inputs are provided.

### Improvement Suggestions

1. **Add Type Checking**:
   ```python
   def remove_vowels(text):
       if not isinstance(text, str):
           raise TypeError("Input must be a string")
       
       vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
       result = []
       
       for char in text:
           if char.lower() not in vowels:
               result.append(char)
       
       return ''.join(result)
   ```

2. **Clarify Case Sensitivity**:
   Add a comment or docstring note about the case sensitivity of the function:
   ```python
   def remove_vowels(text):
       # Converts all characters to lowercase before removing vowels
       vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
       result = []
       
       for char in text:
           if char.lower() not in vowels:
               result.append(char)
       
       return ''.join(result)
   ```

By implementing these suggestions, the code will be more robust and easier to understand for others who may use or maintain it.

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Type Checking**:
   - Added a check to ensure the input is a string. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.

2. **Documentation**:
   - Updated the docstring to explicitly state that the function converts characters to lowercase before removing vowels, ensuring case insensitivity.
   - Added an argument description and return type description for clarity.

These changes enhance the robustness and clarity of the code, making it more reliable and easier to understand for others.
