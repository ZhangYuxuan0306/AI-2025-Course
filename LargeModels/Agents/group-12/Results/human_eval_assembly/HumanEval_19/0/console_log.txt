The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `sort_numbers`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `sort_numbers`. However, `sort_numbers` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `sort_numbers` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(sort_numbers)`, as well as sort_numbers's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

from typing import List


def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    """ Input is a space-delimited string of numberals from 'zero' to 'nine'.
    Valid choices are 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight' and 'nine'.
    Return the string with numbers sorted from smallest to largest
    >>> sort_numbers('three one five')
    'one three five'
    """



# Run the unit tests

### Requirements Analysis

**Key Requirements:**
1. The input is a space-delimited string of numberals from 'zero' to 'nine'.
2. The function should return the string with numbers sorted from smallest to largest.
3. The valid numberals are 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', and 'nine'.

**Input/Output Specifications:**
- **Input:** A string where each word represents a numeral from 'zero' to 'nine', separated by spaces.
- **Output:** A string with the numerals sorted in ascending order.

### Algorithm Design

**Core Algorithm Approach:**
1. Convert the input string into a list of words (numberals).
2. Create a dictionary to map each numeral to its corresponding integer value.
3. Sort the list of numerals based on their integer values using the dictionary for mapping.
4. Join the sorted list back into a single string and return it.

**Time Complexity Analysis:**
- Sorting the list of numerals takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of numerals in the input string.
- Converting the input string and joining the list both take linear time, i.e., \(O(n)\).

Overall, the dominant time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Implementation Strategy

1. Import necessary modules.
2. Define the `sort_numbers` function.
3. Create a dictionary to map numerals to integers.
4. Split the input string into a list of numerals.
5. Sort the list using the dictionary for mapping.
6. Join the sorted list back into a string.
7. Call `run_tests(sort_numbers)` to execute the unit tests.

### Key Function Design

```python
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    # Dictionary mapping numerals to integers
    numeral_to_int = {
        "zero": 0, "one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3, "four": 4,
        "five": 5, "six": 6, "seven": 7, "eight": 8, "nine": 9
    }
    
    # Split the input string into a list of numerals
    numerals = numbers.split()
    
    # Sort the list based on the integer values using the dictionary
    sorted_numerals = sorted(numerals, key=lambda x: numeral_to_int[x])
    
    # Join the sorted list back into a single string
    sorted_string = ' '.join(sorted_numerals)
    
    return sorted_string
```

### Test Case Design Ideas

To ensure the correctness of the `sort_numbers` function, consider the following test cases:

1. **Basic Case:**
   - Input: `'three one five'`
   - Expected Output: `'one three five'`

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Input: `'zero nine eight seven six five four three two one'`
   - Expected Output: `'zero one two three four five six seven eight nine'`
   - Input: `'one one one'`
   - Expected Output: `'one one one'`
   - Input: `'nine eight seven six five four three two one zero'`
   - Expected Output: `'zero one two three four five six seven eight nine'`

3. **Empty String:**
   - Input: `''`
   - Expected Output: `''`

4. **Single Numeral:**
   - Input: `'four'`
   - Expected Output: `'four'`

By covering these test cases, you can validate the robustness of the `sort_numbers` function.

### Code Quality Score (1-10 points)
Score: 8

### Strengths:
1. **Clarity and Readability**: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The use of a dictionary to map numerals to integers makes the sorting process clear and concise.
2. **Efficiency**: The algorithm uses Python’s built-in `sorted()` function, which has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), making it efficient for the given problem size.
3. **Docstring**: The docstring provides a clear description of the function's purpose, parameters, and expected output, which aids in understanding the function's behavior.
4. **Test Coverage**: The inclusion of test cases through `run_tests(sort_numbers)` ensures that the function behaves as expected under various conditions.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Lack of Comments**: While the code is readable, adding comments explaining the logic behind certain steps could make it even more understandable for others who might not be familiar with the problem domain.
2. **Potential for Misuse**: The function assumes that all inputs are valid numerals from 'zero' to 'nine'. Adding validation checks would prevent potential runtime errors due to invalid inputs.

### Functional Correctness
Meets requirements: Yes

### Potential Issues:
1. **No Validation**: The function does not validate whether the input string contains only valid numerals. If an invalid numeral is passed, it may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
2. **Boundary Cases**: Although the provided test cases cover basic and edge scenarios, additional boundary cases such as leading/trailing spaces, multiple spaces between numerals, or non-alphabetic characters could be added for thorough testing.

### Improvement Suggestions:
1. **Add Validation Checks**: Implement checks to ensure that the input string contains only valid numerals from 'zero' to 'nine'. If an invalid numeral is found, raise an appropriate error.
2. **Comments**: Add comments above critical sections of the code to explain the purpose of specific operations.
3. **Additional Test Cases**: Include test cases that cover edge cases such as leading/trailing spaces, multiple spaces between numerals, and non-alphabetic characters.

Example of improved code with validation:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

from typing import List


def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    """ Input is a space-delimited string of numberals from 'zero' to 'nine'.
    Valid choices are 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight' and 'nine'.
    Return the string with numbers sorted from smallest to largest
    >>> sort_numbers('three one five')
    'one three five'
    """
    # Dictionary mapping numerals to integers
    numeral_to_int = {
        "zero": 0, "one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3, "four": 4,
        "five": 5, "six": 6, "seven": 7, "eight": 8, "nine": 9
    }
    
    # Validate input
    for numeral in numbers.split():
        if numeral not in numeral_to_int:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid numeral: {numeral}")
    
    # Split the input string into a list of numerals
    numerals = numbers.split()
    
    # Sort the list based on the integer values using the dictionary
    sorted_numerals = sorted(numerals, key=lambda x: numeral_to_int[x])
    
    # Join the sorted list back into a single string
    sorted_string = ' '.join(sorted_numerals)
    
    return sorted_string


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(sort_numbers)
```

By implementing these improvements, the code will be more robust and easier to maintain.

5. **Comments**: Comments have been added above critical sections to explain the purpose of specific operations, improving readability.

### Functional Correctness
Meets requirements: Yes

### Testing Recommendations:
1. **Run All Provided Tests**: Execute the existing test suite to ensure that the function behaves as expected.
2. **Add Additional Boundary Cases**: Include test cases that cover edge cases such as leading/trailing spaces, multiple spaces between numerals, and non-alphabetic characters.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Input: `' zero nine eight seven six five four three two one '` (with leading/trailing spaces)
   - Expected Output: `' zero one two three four five six seven eight nine '`
   
   - Input: `'one   one   one'` (with multiple spaces between numerals)
   - Expected Output: `'one   one   one'`
   
   - Input: `'one two three four five six seven eight nine ten'` (with an invalid numeral 'ten')
   - Expected Error: `ValueError("Invalid numeral: ten")`
   
   - Input: `''` (empty string)
   - Expected Output: `''`
   
   - Input: `'one'` (single numeral)
   - Expected Output: `'one'`
