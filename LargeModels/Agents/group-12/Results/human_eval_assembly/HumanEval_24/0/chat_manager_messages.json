It should return the largest divisor of `n` that is smaller than `n`.\n3. The function must handle edge cases such as when `n` is 1 or less.\n\n**Input/Output Specifications:**\n- **Input:** An integer `n`.\n- **Output:** The largest divisor of `n` smaller than `n`.\n\n### Algorithm Design\n\n**Core Algorithm Approach:**\n1. Start with the largest possible divisor, which is `n // 2`.\n2. Iterate downwards from `n // 2` to 1.\n3. Check if the current number divides `n` without a remainder.\n4. Return the first number that satisfies the condition.\n\n**Time Complexity Analysis:**\n- The worst-case scenario is when `n` is a prime number, resulting in O(n/2) iterations, which simplifies to O(n).\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n\n**Step-by-step Breakdown:**\n1. Import the necessary module (`my_tests`).\n2. Define the `largest_divisor` function.\n3. Implement the logic to find the largest divisor.\n4. Call `run_tests(largest_divisor)` to execute the tests.\n\n**Key Function Design:**\n- `largest_divisor(n: int) -> int`: This function will find and return the largest divisor of `n` smaller than `n`.\n\n### Proposed Test Case Design Ideas\n\nTo ensure comprehensive testing, consider the following scenarios:\n1. `n = 15` (expected result: 5)\n2. `n = 17` (expected result: 1, since 17 is prime)\n3. `n = 100` (expected result: 50)\n4. `n = 1` (expected result: None, since there is no divisor smaller than 1)\n5. `n = -5` (expected result: None, since negative numbers do not have positive divisors)\n\n### Final Code Block\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return None\n    for i in range(n // 2, 0, -1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return i\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(largest_divisor)\n```\n\nThis code block includes the complete implementation of `largest_divisor`, along with the necessary imports and test call, ensuring it can be run directly in Python to verify its correctness.",

It should return the largest divisor of `n` that is smaller than `n`.\n3. The function must handle edge cases such as when `n` is 1 or less.\n\n**Input/Output Specifications:**\n- **Input:** An integer `n`.\n- **Output:** The largest divisor of `n` smaller than `n`.\n\n### Algorithm Design\n\n**Core Algorithm Approach:**\n1. Start with the largest possible divisor, which is `n // 2`.\n2. Iterate downwards from `n // 2` to 1.\n3. Check if the current number divides `n` without a remainder.\n4. Return the first number that satisfies the condition.\n\n**Time Complexity Analysis:**\n- The worst-case scenario is when `n` is a prime number, resulting in O(n/2) iterations, which simplifies to O(n).\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n\n**Step-by-step Breakdown:**\n1. Import the necessary module (`my_tests`).\n2. Define the `largest_divisor` function.\n3. Implement the logic to find the largest divisor.\n4. Call `run_tests(largest_divisor)` to execute the tests.\n\n**Key Function Design:**\n- `largest_divisor(n: int) -> int`: This function will find and return the largest divisor of `n` smaller than `n`.\n\n### Proposed Test Case Design Ideas\n\nTo ensure comprehensive testing, consider the following scenarios:\n1. `n = 15` (expected result: 5)\n2. `n = 17` (expected result: 1, since 17 is prime)\n3. `n = 100` (expected result: 50)\n4. `n = 1` (expected result: None, since there is no divisor smaller than 1)\n5. `n = -5` (expected result: None, since negative numbers do not have positive divisors)\n\n### Final Code Block\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return None\n    for i in range(n // 2, 0, -1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return i\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(largest_divisor)\n```\n\nThis code block includes the complete implementation of `largest_divisor`, along with the necessary imports and test call, ensuring it can be run directly in Python to verify its correctness.",

It should return the largest divisor of `n` that is smaller than `n`.\n3. The function must handle edge cases such as when `n` is 1 or less.\n\n**Input/Output Specifications:**\n- **Input:** An integer `n`.\n- **Output:** The largest divisor of `n` smaller than `n`.\n\n### Algorithm Design\n\n**Core Algorithm Approach:**\n1. Start with the largest possible divisor, which is `n // 2`.\n2. Iterate downwards from `n // 2` to 1.\n3. Check if the current number divides `n` without a remainder.\n4. Return the first number that satisfies the condition.\n\n**Time Complexity Analysis:**\n- The worst-case scenario is when `n` is a prime number, resulting in O(n/2) iterations, which simplifies to O(n).\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n\n**Step-by-step Breakdown:**\n1. Import the necessary module (`my_tests`).\n2. Define the `largest_divisor` function.\n3. Implement the logic to find the largest divisor.\n4. Call `run_tests(largest_divisor)` to execute the tests.\n\n**Key Function Design:**\n- `largest_divisor(n: int) -> int`: This function will find and return the largest divisor of `n` smaller than `n`.\n\n### Proposed Test Case Design Ideas\n\nTo ensure comprehensive testing, consider the following scenarios:\n1. `n = 15` (expected result: 5)\n2. `n = 17` (expected result: 1, since 17 is prime)\n3. `n = 100` (expected result: 50)\n4. `n = 1` (expected result: None, since there is no divisor smaller than 1)\n5. `n = -5` (expected result: None, since negative numbers do not have positive divisors)\n\n### Final Code Block\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return None\n    for i in range(n // 2, 0, -1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return i\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(largest_divisor)\n```\n\nThis code block includes the complete implementation of `largest_divisor`, along with the necessary imports and test call, ensuring it can be run directly in Python to verify its correctness.",
