Iterate through each number in the list.\n2. Round each number up to the nearest integer using the ceiling function.\n3. Square the rounded number.\n4. Sum all the squared numbers.\n5. Return the total sum.\n\n**Time Complexity Analysis:**\n- Iterating through the list takes O(n) time.\n- Rounding and squaring each number takes constant time O(1).\n- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n\n**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n1. Import necessary modules (`math` for the ceiling function).\n2. Define the `sum_squares` function.\n3. Use a loop to iterate through the list.\n4. Apply the ceiling function and square each number.\n5. Accumulate the sum of the squared numbers.\n6. Call `run_tests(sum_squares)` to execute the unit tests.\n\n**Key Function Design:**\n- `math.ceil(x)`: Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x`.\n- `x ** 2`: Squares the value of `x`.\n\n### Proposed Test Case Design Ideas\n\nTo ensure comprehensive testing, consider the following test cases:\n- List with positive integers.\n- List with negative integers.\n- List with floating-point numbers.\n- Empty list.\n- List with zero.\n\n### Final Code Block\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\ndef sum_squares(lst):\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of numbers.\n    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,\n    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14\n    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98\n    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84\n    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29\n    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6\n    \n    \"\"\"\n    total_sum = 0\n    for num in lst:\n        ceil_num = math.ceil(num)\n        squared_num = ceil_num ** 2\n        total_sum += squared_num\n    return total_sum\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(sum_squares)\n```\n\nThis code block includes the complete implementation of `sum_squares`, along with the necessary imports and test execution call.

            "content": "### Code Quality Review (Style, Readability, Efficiency)\n\n**Code Quality Score: 8**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- **Readability:** The code is relatively straightforward and follows good naming conventions for functions and variables. The docstring provides clear examples and explanations.\n- **Efficiency:** The algorithm iterates through the list once, performing a constant-time operation (ceiling and squaring) for each element, resulting in an efficient O(n) time complexity.\n- **Documentation:** The docstring is detailed and includes example inputs and outputs, which aids in understanding the expected behavior of the function.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Imports:** The `math` module is imported but not used anywhere else in the code. This could be considered redundant unless there are other operations involving mathematical functions.\n- **Comments:** While the docstring serves as documentation, additional comments explaining key steps or edge cases might enhance clarity further.\n\n### Functional Correctness Analysis\n\n**Meets requirements: Yes**\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n- The code appears to meet the functional requirements specified. However, without specific test cases, it\u2019s difficult to confirm absolute correctness across all possible inputs.\n\n### Improvement Suggestions\n\n1. **Remove Redundant Imports:**\n   Since `math` is imported but not used, it should be removed to clean up the code.\n   \n   ```python\n   # Remove this line if it's not needed elsewhere\n   # import math\n   ```\n\n2. **Add Comments:**\n   Adding comments to explain any complex logic or edge cases can improve readability.\n\n   ```python\n   def sum_squares(lst):\n       \"\"\"You are given a list of numbers.\n       You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,\n       round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.\n       Examples:\n       For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14\n       For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98\n       For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84\n       For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29\n       For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6\n      \n       \"\"\"\n       total_sum = 0\n       for num in lst:\n           ceil_num = math.ceil(num)  # Round up to the nearest integer\n           squared_num = ceil_num ** 2  # Square the rounded number\n           total_sum += squared_num\n       return total_sum\n   ```\n\n3. **Edge Case Handling:**\n   Ensure that the function handles edge cases such as empty lists gracefully. The current implementation seems to handle this correctly by returning `0`.\n\n   ```python\n   assert sum_squares([]) == 0, \"Empty list should return 0\"\n   ```\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the code will be more maintainable and easier to understand while still meeting the functional requirements.",
