The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `select_words`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `select_words`. However, `select_words` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `select_words` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(select_words)`, as well as select_words's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def select_words(s, n):
    """Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement 
    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly 
    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
    Examples:
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
    select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
    select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
    select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]
    """



# Run the unit tests

### Requirements Analysis

#### Key Requirements
1. The function `select_words` must take two parameters: a string `s` and a natural number `n`.
2. It should return a list of words from the string `s` that contain exactly `n` consonants.
3. If the string `s` is empty, the function should return an empty list.
4. The input string `s` is assumed to contain only letters and spaces.

#### Input/Output Specifications
- **Input**: A string `s` and a natural number `n`.
- **Output**: A list of words containing exactly `n` consonants.

### Algorithm Design

#### Core Algorithm Approach
1. Split the string `s` into individual words.
2. For each word, count the number of consonants.
3. Collect words that have exactly `n` consonants.
4. Return the collected list of words.

#### Time Complexity Analysis
- Splitting the string into words takes \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the length of the string.
- Counting consonants for each word takes \(O(k \cdot c)\), where \(k\) is the number of words and \(c\) is the average length of the words.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(m + k \cdot c)\).

### Implementation Strategy

1. Import necessary modules (if any).
2. Define the `select_words` function.
3. Implement the logic to split the string, count consonants, and filter words.
4. Call `run_tests(select_words)` to execute the unit tests.

### Key Function Design

#### `select_words` Function
```python
def select_words(s, n):
    if not s:
        return []

    # Helper function to check if a character is a consonant
    def is_consonant(char):
        return char.lower() in 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz'

    # Split the string into words
    words = s.split()

    # Filter words with exactly n consonants
    result = [word for word in words if sum(is_consonant(c) for c in word) == n]

    return result
```

### Test Case Design Ideas

1. Test with an empty string.
2. Test with a string containing no words with exactly `n` consonants.
3. Test with a string containing multiple words with different numbers of consonants.
4. Test with a string having special characters or digits (though they are not allowed by the problem statement).

### Final Code Block

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def select_words(s, n):
    if not s:
        return []

    # Helper function to check if a character is a consonant
    def is_consonant(char):
        return char.lower() in 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz'

    # Split the string into words
    words = s.split()

    # Filter words with exactly n consonants
    result = [word for word in words if sum(is_consonant(c) for c in word) == n]

    return result

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(select_words)
```

This code block includes the complete implementation of `select_words`, along with the necessary imports and the call to `run_tests(select_words)`, making it ready to be executed directly in Python.

engineer (to chat_manager):

Here is the complete code block that includes the implementation of `select_words`, the necessary imports, and the call to `run_tests(select_words)`:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def select_words(s, n):
    """
    Given a string s and a natural number n, this function returns a list of all words from string s 
    that contain exactly n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
    
    :param s: str - the input string
    :param n: int - the exact number of consonants required in a word
    :return: list - a list of words with exactly n consonants
    """
    if not s:
        return []

    # Helper function to check if a character is a consonant
    def is_consonant(char):
        return char.lower() in 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz'

    # Split the string into words
    words = s.split()

    # Filter words with exactly n consonants
    result = [word for word in words if sum(is_consonant(c) for c in word) == n]

    return result

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(select_words)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The `run_tests` function is imported from `my_tests`.
2. **Function Definition**:
   - The `select_words` function takes two parameters: `s` (the input string) and `n` (the number of consonants required in a word).
   - It first checks if the input string `s` is empty and returns an empty list if true.
   - A helper function `is_consonant` is defined to check if a character is a consonant.
   - The string `s` is split into words using the `split()` method.
   - A list comprehension filters out words that contain exactly `n` consonants.
3. **Test Execution**: The `run_tests(select_words)` function is called to execute the unit tests.

This code block ensures that `select_words` is fully implemented and can be tested directly in Python.

### Code Quality Score (1-10 points)
Score: 9

### Strengths:
1. **Clarity and Readability**: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The docstring provides clear documentation, explaining the purpose and parameters of the function.
2. **Efficiency**: The use of list comprehension and generator expressions makes the code efficient and concise.
3. **Helper Function**: The inclusion of a helper function `is_consonant` improves code reusability and clarity.
4. **Boundary Cases Handled**: The function correctly handles the edge case where the input string is empty.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Assumption of Input**: Although the problem states that the input string contains only letters and spaces, the code does not explicitly enforce this assumption. While this is acceptable given the constraints, it could lead to unexpected behavior if other characters are present.
2. **Docstring Completeness**: The docstring could include more examples or specific edge cases to enhance understanding.

### Functional Correctness
Meets requirements: Yes

### Potential Issues:
1. **Assumption Enforcement**: Ensure that the input string strictly contains only letters and spaces to avoid potential bugs related to non-alphabetic characters.
2. **Edge Case Testing**: Verify that the function behaves as expected when the input string contains consecutive spaces or leading/trailing spaces.

### Improvement Suggestions
1. **Input Validation**: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that the input string contains only letters and spaces.
2. **Enhanced Docstring**: Include additional examples and edge cases in the docstring to clarify the expected behavior of the function.
3. **Consistency in Naming**: Ensure consistent naming conventions throughout the code, such as using snake_case for variable names and CamelCase for class names (though not applicable here).

By addressing these suggestions, the code can be further refined and made even more robust.
