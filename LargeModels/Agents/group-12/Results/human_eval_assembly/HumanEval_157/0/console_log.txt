The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `right_angle_triangle`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `right_angle_triangle`. However, `right_angle_triangle` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `right_angle_triangle` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(right_angle_triangle)`, as well as right_angle_triangle's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(right_angle_triangle)

### Requirements Analysis

**Key Requirements:**
1. The function `right_angle_triangle` should determine whether three given side lengths can form a right-angled triangle.
2. A right-angled triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem: \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\), where \(c\) is the longest side (hypotenuse).

**Input/Output Specifications:**
- **Input:** Three integers representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle.
- **Output:** A boolean value (`True` if the sides form a right-angled triangle, `False` otherwise).

### Algorithm Design

**Core Algorithm Approach:**
1. Sort the input sides to ensure that the longest side is considered as the hypotenuse.
2. Check if the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the longest side.

**Time Complexity Analysis:**
- Sorting the sides takes \(O(\log n)\) time, where \(n\) is the number of sides (in this case, always 3).
- The comparison operation takes constant time \(O(1)\).
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(\log n)\), which simplifies to \(O(1)\) since \(n\) is constant.

### Implementation Strategy

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
1. Import the necessary module for running tests.
2. Define the `right_angle_triangle` function.
3. Sort the input sides.
4. Apply the Pythagorean theorem to check if they form a right-angled triangle.
5. Call the `run_tests` function with `right_angle_triangle`.

**Key Function Design:**
- The main function `right_angle_triangle` will take three integer arguments.
- It will sort these integers and apply the Pythagorean theorem to determine if they form a right-angled triangle.

### Code Block

Here is the complete code block that includes the implementation of `right_angle_triangle`, along with the call to `run_tests`:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''
    # Sort the sides to ensure the longest side is last
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    
    # Check if the Pythagorean theorem holds
    return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(right_angle_triangle)
```

This code block can be run directly in Python to verify the correctness of the `right_angle_triangle` function using the provided unit tests.

### Code Quality Review

**Score: 8**

#### Strengths:
1. **Functionality**: The function correctly implements the logic to check for a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.
2. **Readability**: The code is readable with clear variable names and comments explaining the purpose of each step.
3. **Efficiency**: The sorting operation has a time complexity of \(O(\log n)\), but since \(n\) is always 3, it effectively reduces to \(O(1)\). The comparison operation is also \(O(1)\), making the overall time complexity \(O(1)\).

#### Weaknesses:
1. **Documentation**: While there is some documentation, it could be more detailed. For example, specifying the types of inputs and outputs would help clarify the function's contract.
2. **Error Handling**: The function does not handle cases where the input is not valid (e.g., non-positive numbers or non-integer values). Adding error handling would make the function more robust.

### Functional Correctness

**Meets requirements: Yes**

The function correctly identifies whether the given sides form a right-angled triangle based on the Pythagorean theorem.

**Potential issues: None identified**

### Improvement Suggestions

1. **Enhanced Documentation**:
   - Add type hints to specify the expected types of inputs and outputs.
   - Provide examples in the docstring that include edge cases and invalid inputs.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Add checks to ensure the input values are positive integers.
   - Raise appropriate exceptions or return specific values when the input is invalid.

### Revised Code

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def right_angle_triangle(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> bool:
    """
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle, return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    
    Parameters:
    a (int): Length of the first side.
    b (int): Length of the second side.
    c (int): Length of the third side.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    
    Examples:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    
    Raises:
    ValueError: If any of the sides are non-positive integers.
    """
    if not all(isinstance(side, int) and side > 0 for side in [a, b, c]):
        raise ValueError("All sides must be positive integers.")
    
    # Sort the sides to ensure the longest side is last
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    
    # Check if the Pythagorean theorem holds
    return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(right_angle_triangle)
```

This revised version includes enhanced documentation and basic error handling to make the function more robust and easier to understand.
