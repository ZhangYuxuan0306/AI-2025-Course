The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `even_odd_count`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `even_odd_count`. However, `even_odd_count` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `even_odd_count` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(even_odd_count)`, as well as even_odd_count's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def even_odd_count(num):
    """Given an integer. return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.

     Example:
        even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)
        even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)
    """



# Run the unit tests

### Requirements Analysis

**Key Requirements:**
1. The function `even_odd_count` should take an integer as input.
2. It should return a tuple containing two elements: the first element is the count of even digits, and the second element is the count of odd digits in the given integer.
3. The function should handle negative numbers correctly by ignoring the sign.

**Input/Output Specifications:**
- **Input:** An integer (`num`)
- **Output:** A tuple `(even_count, odd_count)`

### Algorithm Design

**Core Algorithm Approach:**
1. Convert the absolute value of the input number to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
2. Initialize counters for even and odd digits to zero.
3. Iterate through each character in the string representation of the number:
   - Convert the character back to an integer.
   - Check if the digit is even or odd using the modulus operator `%`.
   - Increment the respective counter based on whether the digit is even or odd.
4. Return the counts as a tuple.

**Time Complexity Analysis:**
- Converting the number to a string takes O(d) time, where d is the number of digits.
- Iterating through the string takes O(d) time.
- Overall time complexity: O(d)

### Implementation Strategy

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
1. Import the `run_tests` function from `my_tests.py`.
2. Define the `even_odd_count` function with the specified logic.
3. Call `run_tests(even_odd_count)` to execute the unit tests.

**Key Function Design:**
- `even_odd_count`: This function will implement the logic described above.

### Proposed Test Case Design Ideas

To ensure comprehensive testing, consider the following scenarios:
1. Positive integers with mixed even and odd digits.
2. Negative integers with mixed even and odd digits.
3. Integers with all even digits.
4. Integers with all odd digits.
5. Zero.
6. Single-digit numbers.

### Final Code Block

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def even_odd_count(num):
    """Given an integer. return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.

     Example:
        even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)
        even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)
    """
    num = abs(num)  # Handle negative numbers by converting to positive
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    for char in str(num):
        digit = int(char)
        if digit % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
    
    return (even_count, odd_count)

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(even_odd_count)
```

This code block includes the complete implementation of `even_odd_count`, along with the necessary imports and test call, making it ready to be executed directly in Python.

Here is the complete code block that includes the implementation of `even_odd_count`, the necessary imports, and the call to `run_tests(even_odd_count)`:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def even_odd_count(num):
    """Given an integer, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.

    Example:
        even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)
        even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)
    """
    num = abs(num)  # Handle negative numbers by converting to positive
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    for char in str(num):
        digit = int(char)
        if digit % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
    
    return (even_count, odd_count)

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(even_odd_count)
```

This code is designed to meet the requirements specified in the problem statement. It includes a clear and concise implementation of the `even_odd_count` function, which handles both positive and negative integers and returns the correct counts of even and odd digits. The code also adheres to PEP8 standards and includes necessary comments and documentation. Finally, it calls `run_tests(even_odd_count)` to execute the automated unit tests.

### Code Quality Review (Style, Readability, Efficiency)

**Score: 9**

#### Strengths:
1. **Readability**: The code is well-structured and easy to follow. The function name `even_odd_count` clearly indicates its purpose, and the docstring provides a good example of how the function should work.
2. **Efficiency**: The algorithm iterates through each digit once, making the time complexity O(d), where d is the number of digits in the input number. This is efficient for the problem at hand.
3. **PEP8 Compliance**: The code follows PEP8 guidelines, such as proper indentation, line length limits, and consistent use of white spaces around operators.
4. **Comments and Documentation**: The docstring is detailed and includes examples, which aids in understanding the function’s behavior without needing additional context.

#### Weaknesses:
1. **Error Handling**: There is no error handling for non-integer inputs. If a non-integer is passed to `even_odd_count`, it will raise a `TypeError`.

### Functional Correctness Analysis

**Meets requirements: Yes**

The function `even_odd_count` correctly counts the number of even and odd digits in the input integer, including handling negative numbers. The provided test cases would likely cover the requirements effectively.

### Boundary Case Handling Check

**Potential Issues:**
1. **Non-Integer Inputs**: The function does not handle non-integer inputs gracefully. Passing a non-integer to `even_odd_count` will result in a `TypeError`.

### Potential Bug Identification

**Potential Issues:**
1. **Edge Cases**: While the current implementation handles most common edge cases, there might be specific edge cases not covered by the existing test suite, such as very large numbers or extremely small numbers.

### Improvement Suggestions

1. **Add Error Handling**: Implement error handling to ensure that the function only accepts integers. For example:
    ```python
    def even_odd_count(num):
        if not isinstance(num, int):
            raise ValueError("Input must be an integer")
        num = abs(num)
        even_count = 0
        odd_count = 0
        
        for char in str(num):
            digit = int(char)
            if digit % 2 == 0:
                even_count += 1
            else:
                odd_count += 1
        
        return (even_count, odd_count)
    ```

2. **Enhance Test Suite**: Consider adding more test cases to ensure comprehensive coverage, especially for edge cases like very large numbers or extremely small numbers.

3. **Code Comments**: Add comments to explain the purpose of each major step within the function for better clarity and maintainability.

By implementing these suggestions, the code will be more robust and easier to understand for future maintenance.

        raise ValueError("Input must be an integer")
    
    # Handle negative numbers by converting to positive
    num = abs(num)
    
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each character in the string representation of the number
    for char in str(num):
        digit = int(char)
        
        # Check if the digit is even or odd
        if digit % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
    
    return (even_count, odd_count)

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(even_odd_count)
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Added a check to ensure that the input is an integer. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.

2. **Enhanced Comments**:
   - Added a docstring that explains the function's arguments, return type, and provides examples. This improves the readability and usability of the function.

3. **Code Structure**:
   - Kept the structure of the function the same but added comments to explain each major step within the function.

These changes make the code more robust and easier to understand, ensuring that it handles potential errors gracefully and is well-documented.
