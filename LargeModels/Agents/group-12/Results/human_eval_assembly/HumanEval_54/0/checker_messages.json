            "content": "### Requirements Analysis\n\n**Key requirements**\n- The function `same_chars` should determine if two input strings contain the same characters, regardless of their frequency or order.\n- The comparison should be case-sensitive.\n\n**Input/output specifications**\n- **Inputs**: Two strings `s0` and `s1`.\n- **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether the two strings contain the same characters.\n\n### Algorithm Design\n\n**Core algorithm approach**\n1. Convert both input strings into sets of unique characters.\n2. Compare the sets for equality.\n\n**Time complexity analysis**\n- Converting each string to a set takes O(n) time, where n is the length of the string.\n- Comparing two sets takes O(min(m, n)) time, where m and n are the sizes of the sets.\n- Overall time complexity: O(n + min(m, n)), which simplifies to O(n).\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n\n**Step-by-step breakdown**\n1. Import the `run_tests` function from `my_tests.py`.\n2. Define the `same_chars` function:\n   - Convert both input strings to sets of unique characters.\n   - Return the result of comparing these sets.\n3. Call `run_tests(same_chars)` to execute the unit tests.\n\n**Key function design**\n- `same_chars`: Takes two strings, converts them to sets, and returns the result of their equality check.\n\n### Proposed Test Case Design Ideas\n\nTo ensure comprehensive testing, consider the following scenarios:\n- Strings with identical characters but different frequencies.\n- Strings with identical characters in the same order.\n- Strings with identical characters in different orders.\n- Strings with different characters.\n- Empty strings.\n\n### Final Code Block\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\ndef same_chars(s0: str, s1: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if two words have the same characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    return set(s0) == set(s1)\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(same_chars)\n```\n\nThis code block includes the complete implementation of `same_chars`, the import statement for `run_tests`, and the call to `run_tests(same_chars)` to execute the automated unit tests.",
