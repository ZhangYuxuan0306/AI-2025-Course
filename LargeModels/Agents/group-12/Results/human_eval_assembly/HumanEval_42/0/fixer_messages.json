            "content": "### Requirements Analysis\n\n#### Key Requirements\n- The `incr_list` function must take a list of integers as input.\n- It must return a new list where each element of the input list has been incremented by 1.\n- The function should handle both positive and negative integers.\n- Edge cases such as empty lists or lists containing non-integer values should be considered.\n\n#### Input/Output Specifications\n- **Input**: A list of integers (`l: list`).\n- **Output**: A new list with each element incremented by 1 (`list`).\n\n### Algorithm Design\n\n#### Core Algorithm Approach\n1. Initialize an empty list to store the incremented values.\n2. Iterate through each element in the input list.\n3. Increment each element by 1.\n4. Append the incremented value to the result list.\n5. Return the result list.\n\n#### Time Complexity Analysis\n- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because we need to iterate through each element once.\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n\n#### Step-by-Step Breakdown\n1. Import the `run_tests` function from `my_tests`.\n2. Define the `incr_list` function.\n3. Implement the logic to increment each element in the list.\n4. Call `run_tests(incr_list)` to execute the unit tests.\n\n#### Key Function Design\n```python\ndef incr_list(l: list):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the incremented values\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the input list\n    for num in l:\n        # Increment each element by 1 and append to the result list\n        result.append(num + 1)\n    \n    # Return the result list\n    return result\n```\n\n### Test Case Design Ideas\nTo ensure the correctness of the `incr_list` function, we should consider the following test cases:\n- Test with a list of positive integers.\n- Test with a list of negative integers.\n- Test with a list containing zero.\n- Test with an empty list.\n- Test with a list containing a mix of positive and negative integers.\n- Test with a list containing non-integer values (should raise an error if not handled correctly).\n\nHere is the complete code block that includes the implementation and the test call:\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\ndef incr_list(l: list):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the incremented values\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the input list\n    for num in l:\n        # Increment each element by 1 and append to the result list\n        result.append(num + 1)\n    \n    # Return the result list\n    return result\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(incr_list)\n```\n\nThis code block can be executed directly in Python to validate the implementation of the `incr_list` function.",
