The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `specialFilter`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `specialFilter`. However, `specialFilter` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `specialFilter` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(specialFilter)`, as well as specialFilter's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def specialFilter(nums):
    """Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns 
    the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both 
    first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
    For example:
    specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]) => 1 
    specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) => 2
    """

### Requirements Analysis

**Key Requirements:**
- The function `specialFilter` must take an array of numbers as input.
- It should return the count of numbers that satisfy two conditions:
  1. The number is greater than 10.
  2. Both the first and last digits of the number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).

**Input/Output Specifications:**
- **Input:** A list of integers (`nums`).
- **Output:** An integer representing the count of numbers meeting the specified criteria.

### Algorithm Design

**Core Algorithm Approach:**
1. Initialize a counter to zero.
2. Iterate through each number in the input list.
3. For each number, check if it meets the criteria:
   - It is greater than 10.
   - Both the first and last digits are odd.
4. If the number meets all criteria, increment the counter.
5. Return the counter after iterating through all numbers.

**Time Complexity Analysis:**
- The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because we need to iterate through each element once.

### Implementation Strategy

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. Define the `specialFilter` function.
2. Implement logic to check if a number is greater than 10.
3. Extract the first and last digits of a number.
4. Check if both digits are odd.
5. Count numbers that meet the criteria.
6. Import `run_tests` from `my_tests`.
7. Call `run_tests(specialFilter)`.

**Key Function Design:**

- `is_odd_digit(digit)`: Helper function to check if a digit is odd.
- `extract_first_last_digits(num)`: Helper function to extract the first and last digits of a number.
- `specialFilter(nums)`: Main function to filter and count numbers based on the given criteria.

### Detailed Code Implementation

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def is_odd_digit(digit):
    """Helper function to check if a digit is odd."""
    return digit % 2 != 0

def extract_first_last_digits(num):
    """Helper function to extract the first and last digits of a number."""
    num_str = str(abs(num))  # Ensure the number is positive for easy extraction
    first_digit = int(num_str[0])
    last_digit = int(num_str[-1])
    return first_digit, last_digit

def specialFilter(nums):
    """Function to count numbers greater than 10 with both first and last digits odd."""
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            first_digit, last_digit = extract_first_last_digits(num)
            if is_odd_digit(first_digit) and is_odd_digit(last_digit):
                count += 1
    return count

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(specialFilter)
```

This code completes the implementation of `specialFilter` and includes everything needed to run the tests directly in Python.

                count += 1
    return count

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(specialFilter)
```

This code block contains the complete implementation of the `specialFilter` function along with helper functions `is_odd_digit` and `extract_first_last_digits`. It also includes the necessary import statement for `run_tests` and calls `run_tests(specialFilter)` to execute the unit tests.

### Code Quality Review

**Score: 8**

#### Strengths:
1. **Modular Design**: The code is modularized with helper functions (`is_odd_digit` and `extract_first_last_digits`) which makes it easier to read and maintain.
2. **Clear Documentation**: Each function has a docstring explaining its purpose and functionality.
3. **Efficiency**: The algorithm iterates through the list only once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), which is efficient for this problem.

#### Weaknesses:
1. **Edge Case Handling**: There is no explicit handling for edge cases such as empty lists or non-integer values in the input list. While these might not be part of the primary requirements, it’s good practice to handle them.
2. **String Conversion**: Converting the number to a string for digit extraction could potentially lead to performance issues for very large numbers. However, this is unlikely to be a significant concern unless dealing with extremely large datasets.
3. **Code Readability**: The variable names (`first_digit`, `last_digit`, `count`) are clear but could be slightly more descriptive to improve readability further.

### Functional Correctness

**Meets requirements: Yes**

The function correctly counts numbers greater than 10 with both first and last digits being odd. The provided test cases would validate the correctness of the implementation.

### Potential Issues

1. **Handling Non-Integer Values**: The function does not handle non-integer values gracefully. If the input list contains non-integer values, it will raise a `TypeError`.
2. **Empty List**: If the input list is empty, the function will return 0, which is correct but could be handled explicitly for better clarity.

### Improvement Suggestions

1. **Add Type Checking**: Ensure that all elements in the input list are integers before processing.
2. **Handle Edge Cases**: Explicitly handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists containing non-integer values.
3. **Descriptive Variable Names**: Consider renaming variables like `first_digit` and `last_digit` to something more descriptive, e.g., `leading_digit` and `trailing_digit`.

### Revised Code Block

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def is_odd_digit(digit):
    """Helper function to check if a digit is odd."""
    return digit % 2 != 0

def extract_first_last_digits(num):
    """Helper function to extract the first and last digits of a number."""
    num_str = str(abs(num))  # Ensure the number is positive for easy extraction
    leading_digit = int(num_str[0])
    trailing_digit = int(num_str[-1])
    return leading_digit, trailing_digit

def specialFilter(nums):
    """Function to count numbers greater than 10 with both first and last digits odd."""
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if isinstance(num, int) and num > 10:
            leading_digit, trailing_digit = extract_first_last_digits(num)
            if is_odd_digit(leading_digit) and is_odd_digit(trailing_digit):
                count += 1
    return count

# Handle edge cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage
    print(specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]))  # Output: 1
    print(specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]))  # Output: 2

    # Run the unit tests
    run_tests(specialFilter)
```

In this revised version, type checking is added to ensure that only integers are processed, and edge cases are handled explicitly. This improves the robustness of the code while maintaining readability.

### Final Code Block

Here is the final version of the code block that addresses the identified issues and improvements:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def is_odd_digit(digit):
    """Helper function to check if a digit is odd."""
    return digit % 2 != 0

def extract_first_last_digits(num):
    """Helper function to extract the first and last digits of a number."""
    num_str = str(abs(num))  # Ensure the number is positive for easy extraction
    leading_digit = int(num_str[0])
    trailing_digit = int(num_str[-1])
    return leading_digit, trailing_digit

def specialFilter(nums):
    """Function to count numbers greater than 10 with both first and last digits odd."""
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if isinstance(num, int) and num > 10:
            leading_digit, trailing_digit = extract_first_last_digits(num)
            if is_odd_digit(leading_digit) and is_odd_digit(trailing_digit):
                count += 1
    return count

# Handle edge cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage
    print(specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]))  # Output: 1
    print(specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]))  # Output: 2

    # Run the unit tests
    run_tests(specialFilter)
```

### Summary of Changes

1. **Type Checking**: Added `isinstance(num, int)` to ensure that only integers are processed.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: Added a simple script to demonstrate usage and call `run_tests(specialFilter)` when running the script directly.
3. **Variable Naming**: Kept the variable names clear but slightly more descriptive where appropriate.

This code now meets all the requirements, handles edge cases, and is robust against non-integer inputs. It is ready to be tested and used directly in Python.
