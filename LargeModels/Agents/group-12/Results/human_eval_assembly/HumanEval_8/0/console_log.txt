The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `sum_product`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `sum_product`. However, `sum_product` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `sum_product` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(sum_product)`, as well as sum_product's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

from typing import List, Tuple


def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """



# Run the unit tests

### Requirements Analysis

#### Key Requirements:
1. The function `sum_product` must take a list of integers as input.
2. It should return a tuple where the first element is the sum of the integers and the second element is the product of the integers.
3. If the input list is empty, the sum should be 0 and the product should be 1.

#### Input/Output Specifications:
- **Input**: A list of integers (`List[int]`)
- **Output**: A tuple containing two integers (`Tuple[int, int]`)

### Algorithm Design

#### Core Algorithm Approach:
1. Initialize variables for the sum and product.
2. Iterate through each number in the list:
   - Add the number to the sum.
   - Multiply the number with the product.
3. Return the sum and product as a tuple.

#### Time Complexity Analysis:
- The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because we iterate through the list once.

### Implementation Strategy

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. Import necessary modules.
2. Define the `sum_product` function.
3. Implement the logic inside the `sum_product` function.
4. Call `run_tests(sum_product)` to execute the unit tests.

#### Key Function Design:
```python
def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Initialize sum and product
    total_sum = 0
    total_product = 1
    
    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for num in numbers:
        total_sum += num
        total_product *= num
    
    # Return the sum and product as a tuple
    return total_sum, total_product
```

### Test Case Design Ideas
To ensure the correctness of the `sum_product` function, we need to cover various scenarios, including:
- An empty list.
- A list with one element.
- A list with multiple elements.
- A list with negative numbers.
- A list with zero.

Here are some sample test cases:
```python
def test_sum_product():
    assert sum_product([]) == (0, 1), "Test with empty list failed"
    assert sum_product([1]) == (1, 1), "Test with single element [1] failed"
    assert sum_product([2, 3]) == (5, 6), "Test with two elements [2, 3] failed"
    assert sum_product([-1, 2, -3, 4]) == (2, 24), "Test with mixed signs [-1, 2, -3, 4] failed"
    assert sum_product([0, 2, 3]) == (5, 0), "Test with zero [0, 2, 3] failed"

# Run the test cases
test_sum_product()
```

### Final Code Block
```python
from my_tests import run_tests

from typing import List, Tuple


def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Initialize sum and product
    total_sum = 0
    total_product = 1
    
    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for num in numbers:
        total_sum += num
        total_product *= num
    
    # Return the sum and product as a tuple
    return total_sum, total_product


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(sum_product)
```

This code block includes the complete implementation of `sum_product`, the necessary imports, and the call to `run_tests(sum_product)` to execute the automated unit tests.

### Code Quality Review

**Score: 8**

**Strengths:**
1. **Readability:** The code is generally readable with clear variable names and straightforward logic.
2. **Efficiency:** The implementation has a linear time complexity of O(n), which is efficient for this problem.
3. **Docstring:** The docstring provides a clear description of the function and its expected behavior.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Type Annotations:** While type hints are provided, they could be more detailed. For example, specifying the type of `numbers` in the docstring would improve clarity.
2. **Edge Cases:** Although the function handles the edge case of an empty list correctly, it does not explicitly handle other edge cases like lists with negative numbers or zeros. Adding comments to explain how these cases are handled would enhance understanding.

### Functional Correctness

**Meets requirements: Yes**

**Potential issues:**
1. No explicit handling for lists with negative numbers or zeros. Ensure that the function behaves as expected in these scenarios.

### Improvement Suggestions

1. **Enhance Type Annotations:**
   ```python
   def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
       """
       For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
       Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
       
       Args:
           numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.
           
       Returns:
           Tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing the sum and product of the integers.
           
       Examples:
           >>> sum_product([])
           (0, 1)
           >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
           (10, 24)
       """
       total_sum = 0
       total_product = 1
       
       for num in numbers:
           total_sum += num
           total_product *= num
       
       return total_sum, total_product
   ```

2. **Add Comments for Edge Cases:**
   ```python
   def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
       """
       For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
       Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
       
       Args:
           numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.
           
       Returns:
           Tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing the sum and product of the integers.
           
       Examples:
           >>> sum_product([])
           (0, 1)
           >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
           (10, 24)
       """
       total_sum = 0
       total_product = 1
       
       for num in numbers:
           total_sum += num
           total_product *= num
       
       return total_sum, total_product
   ```

By addressing these suggestions, the code will become even more robust and easier to understand.

    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.

    Returns:
        Tuple[int, int]: A tuple containing the sum and product of the integers.
        
    Examples:
        >>> sum_product([])
        (0, 1)
        >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])

    # Return the sum and product as a tuple
    return total_sum, total_product


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(sum_product)
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Enhanced Type Annotations:**
   - Added `Args` and `Returns` sections in the docstring to specify the types of inputs and outputs.
   - Included a brief explanation of what each section represents.

2. **Comments for Edge Cases:**
   - Since the existing implementation already handles the edge case of an empty list correctly, no additional comments were added for this specific scenario.
   - However, if there were any specific concerns about handling other edge cases (e.g., lists with negative numbers or zeros), those could be addressed here by adding appropriate comments.

By making these enhancements, the code becomes more informative and easier to understand, ensuring that it meets all the specified requirements and potential edge cases.
