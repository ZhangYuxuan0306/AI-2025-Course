The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `x_or_y`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `x_or_y`. However, `x_or_y` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `x_or_y` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(x_or_y)`, as well as x_or_y's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    """A simple program which should return the value of x if n is 
    a prime number and should return the value of y otherwise.

    Examples:
    for x_or_y(7, 34, 12) == 34
    for x_or_y(15, 8, 5) == 5
    
    """



# Run the unit tests

### Requirements Analysis

**Key Requirements:**
1. The function `x_or_y` should take three parameters: `n`, `x`, and `y`.
2. It should determine whether `n` is a prime number.
3. If `n` is a prime number, it should return the value of `x`.
4. If `n` is not a prime number, it should return the value of `y`.

**Input/Output Specifications:**
- **Input:** Three integers (`n`, `x`, `y`).
- **Output:** An integer, either `x` or `y`, depending on whether `n` is a prime number.

### Algorithm Design

**Core Algorithm Approach:**
1. Implement a helper function to check if a number is prime.
2. Use this helper function within `x_or_y` to determine if `n` is prime.
3. Return `x` if `n` is prime, otherwise return `y`.

**Time Complexity Analysis:**
- Checking if a number is prime has a time complexity of \(O(\sqrt{n})\), where \(n\) is the number being checked.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity of `x_or_y` is \(O(\sqrt{n})\).

### Implementation Strategy

1. Define a helper function `is_prime(num)` to check if a number is prime.
2. Implement the main function `x_or_y(n, x, y)` using the helper function.
3. Import `my_tests` and call `run_tests(x_or_y)` at the end.

### Key Function Design

- **Helper Function: `is_prime(num)`**
  - Returns `True` if `num` is a prime number, otherwise returns `False`.
  
- **Main Function: `x_or_y(n, x, y)`**
  - Uses `is_prime(n)` to determine if `n` is prime.
  - Returns `x` if `n` is prime, otherwise returns `y`.

### Test Case Design Ideas

1. **Basic Prime Check:**
   - Input: `n = 7`, `x = 34`, `y = 12`
   - Expected Output: `34`

2. **Non-Prime Check:**
   - Input: `n = 15`, `x = 8`, `y = 5`
   - Expected Output: `5`

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Input: `n = 2`, `x = 10`, `y = 20` (smallest prime)
   - Expected Output: `10`
   
   - Input: `n = 1`, `x = 10`, `y = 20` (not a prime)
   - Expected Output: `20`

### Final Code Block

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def is_prime(num):
    """Check if a number is a prime number."""
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    """Return x if n is a prime number, otherwise return y."""
    if is_prime(n):
        return x
    else:
        return y

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(x_or_y)
```

This code block includes the complete implementation of `x_or_y`, the helper function `is_prime`, and the necessary imports and test calls to verify its correctness.

### Code Quality Review

#### Style and Readability
- **Consistent Naming:** Variable names like `num`, `n`, `x`, `y` are clear and concise.
- **Docstrings:** The docstrings for both functions are well-written and provide good examples.
- **Imports:** The import statement is placed at the top, which is standard practice.
- **Code Formatting:** The code is properly formatted with consistent indentation and spacing.

**Strengths:**
- Clear naming conventions.
- Well-documented functions.
- Properly formatted code.

**Weaknesses:**
- No comments explaining complex logic or decisions.
- Could benefit from more descriptive variable names in some places (e.g., `i` in `is_prime` could be named `factor`).

### Functional Correctness Analysis

**Meets Requirements:**
Yes

**Potential Issues:**
- The current implementation correctly checks if a number is prime and uses this to decide between returning `x` or `y`.
- The helper function `is_prime` handles edge cases such as numbers less than or equal to 1 and optimizes the check by skipping even numbers and multiples of 3 after checking 2 and 3.

### Boundary Case Handling Check

**Boundary Cases Handled:**
- Numbers less than or equal to 1 are correctly identified as not prime.
- The smallest prime number (2) is handled correctly.
- Non-prime numbers are correctly identified and handled.

### Potential Bug Identification

**Bugs Identified:**
- None identified during the initial review.

### Improvement Suggestions

1. **Comments:**
   - Add comments to explain the purpose of complex parts of the code, especially the optimization in the `is_prime` function.

2. **Descriptive Variable Names:**
   - Consider renaming `i` to something more descriptive, such as `factor`, in the `is_prime` function.

3. **Additional Tests:**
   - While the provided test cases cover basic scenarios, consider adding more edge cases, such as large prime numbers and very large non-prime numbers, to ensure robustness.

### Final Review Summary

**Code Quality Score (1-10 points):**
Score: 9

**Strengths:**
- Clear naming conventions.
- Well-documented functions.
- Properly formatted code.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lack of comments.
- Could benefit from more descriptive variable names.

**Functional Correctness:**
Meets requirements: Yes

**Potential Issues:**
None identified during the initial review.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
1. Add comments to explain complex parts of the code.
2. Rename variables for better readability.
3. Consider adding additional test cases for edge scenarios.

    if is_prime(n):
        return x
    else:
        return y

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(x_or_y)
```

### Additional Improvements

1. **Comments:**
   - Added comments to explain the purpose of each part of the `is_prime` function, particularly the loop and the incrementing of the `factor`.

2. **Descriptive Variable Names:**
   - Renamed `i` to `factor` in the `is_prime` function to make it clearer what the variable represents.

3. **Testing Recommendations:**
   - Consider adding more test cases, especially for larger numbers and edge cases like extremely large prime numbers and non-prime numbers.

### Final Code Quality Score (1-10 points)

**Score: 9**

**Strengths:**
- Clear naming conventions.
- Well-documented functions.
- Properly formatted code.
- Comments added to explain complex parts of the code.
- Descriptive variable names used.

**Weaknesses:**
- None identified.

**Functional Correctness:**
Meets requirements: Yes

**Potential Issues:**
None identified during the initial review.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
None required. The code is now optimized and meets all specified requirements.
