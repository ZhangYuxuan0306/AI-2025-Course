The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `double_the_difference`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `double_the_difference`. However, `double_the_difference` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `double_the_difference` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(double_the_difference)`, as well as double_the_difference's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def double_the_difference(lst):
    '''
    Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
    in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
    
    double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10
    double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
    double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
    double_the_difference([0]) == 0  
   
    If the input list is empty, return 0.
    '''



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(double_the_difference)
```

coder (to chat_manager):

Certainly! Below is a stand-alone code block that includes everything needed to run the `double_the_difference` function and its test suite:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def double_the_difference(lst):
    '''
    Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
    in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
    
    double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10
    double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
    double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
    double_the_difference([0]) == 0  
   
    If the input list is empty, return 0.
    '''
    sum_of_squares = 0
    for num in lst:
        if isinstance(num, int) and num > 0 and num % 2 != 0:
            sum_of_squares += num ** 2
    return sum_of_squares

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(double_the_difference)
```

This code defines the `double_the_difference` function as described in your comments and includes the necessary imports to run the test suite. You can directly execute this block in a Python environment to verify its correctness.
