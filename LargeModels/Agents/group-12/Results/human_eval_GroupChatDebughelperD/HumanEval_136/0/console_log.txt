degub_agent (to chat_manager):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `largest_smallest_integers`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `largest_smallest_integers`. However, `largest_smallest_integers` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `largest_smallest_integers` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(largest_smallest_integers)`, as well as largest_smallest_integers's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    '''
    Create a function that returns a tuple (a, b), where 'a' is
    the largest of negative integers, and 'b' is the smallest
    of positive integers in a list.
    If there is no negative or positive integers, return them as None.

    Examples:
    largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]) == (None, 1)
    largest_smallest_integers([]) == (None, None)
    largest_smallest_integers([0]) == (None, None)
    '''



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(largest_smallest_integers)
```
