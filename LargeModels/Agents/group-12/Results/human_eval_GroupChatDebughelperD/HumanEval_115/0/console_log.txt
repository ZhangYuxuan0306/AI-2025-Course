The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `max_fill`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `max_fill`. However, `max_fill` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `max_fill` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(max_fill)`, as well as max_fill's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    """
    You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,
    and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.
    Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, 
    and all buckets have the same capacity.
    Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.
    Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.

    Example 1:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]
            bucket_capacity : 1
        Output: 6

    Example 2:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]
            bucket_capacity : 2
        Output: 5
    
    Example 3:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]
            bucket_capacity : 5
        Output: 0

    Constraints:
        * all wells have the same length
        * 1 <= grid.length <= 10^2
        * 1 <= grid[:,1].length <= 10^2
        * grid[i][j] -> 0 | 1
        * 1 <= capacity <= 10

degub_agent (to chat_manager):

The error message indicates that the `math` module is not imported. 

To fix this issue, you need to add an import statement at the beginning of your code to import the `math` module.

```python
import math  # Add this line to import the math module


from my_tests import run_tests


def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    total_water = 0

    for row in grid:
        water_in_row = sum(row)
        total_water += math.ceil(water_in_row / capacity)

    return total_water


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(max_fill)
```

However, it's generally more common to put import statements after function definitions. Here is a better-refactored version of your code:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

import math  # Move the import statement here for clarity and organization purposes


def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    total_water = 0

    for row in grid:
        water_in_row = sum(row)
        total_water += math.ceil(water_in_row / capacity)

    return total_water
# Run the unit tests
run_tests(max_fill)
```

This way, you ensure that all necessary imports have been loaded before your code tries to use any imported functions or classes.
