The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `fruit_distribution`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `fruit_distribution`. However, `fruit_distribution` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `fruit_distribution` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(fruit_distribution)`, as well as fruit_distribution's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def fruit_distribution(s,n):
    """
    In this task, you will be given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges 
    that are distributed in a basket of fruit this basket contains 
    apples, oranges, and mango fruits. Given the string that represents the total number of 
    the oranges and apples and an integer that represent the total number of the fruits 
    in the basket return the number of the mango fruits in the basket.
    for examble:
    fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19) ->19 - 5 - 6 = 8
    fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges",3) -> 3 - 0 - 1 = 2
    fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100) -> 100 - 2 - 3 = 95
    fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges",120) -> 120 - 100 - 1 = 19
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(fruit_distribution)
```

    # Extract numbers from the string using regular expressions
    import re
    apples, oranges = map(int, re.findall(r'\d+', s))
    
    return n - (apples + oranges)


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(fruit_distribution)
```

This code now correctly implements the `fruit_distribution` function, which calculates the number of mango fruits in the basket by subtracting the sum of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits. The regular expressions are used to extract the numbers from the string representation of the input.
