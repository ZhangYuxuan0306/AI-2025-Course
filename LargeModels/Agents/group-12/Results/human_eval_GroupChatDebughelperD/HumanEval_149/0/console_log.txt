degub_agent (to chat_manager):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `sorted_list_sum`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `sorted_list_sum`. However, `sorted_list_sum` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `sorted_list_sum` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(sorted_list_sum)`, as well as sorted_list_sum's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    """Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,
    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,
    and returns the resulted list with a sorted order,
    The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,
    and it may contain duplicates.
    The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you
    should return the list sorted by that rule.
    If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.
    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.
    You may assume that all words will have the same length.
    For example:
    assert list_sort(["aa", "a", "aaa"]) => ["aa"]
    assert list_sort(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) => ["ab", "cd"]
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(sorted_list_sum)
```

coder (to chat_manager):

Certainly! Below is a complete standalone code block that includes everything needed to run the tests for `sorted_list_sum`, including its definition and the test function call.

```python
def sorted_list_sum(lst):    
    """Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,
    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,
    and returns the resulted list with a sorted order.
    The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,
    and it may contain duplicates.
    The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you
    should return the list sorted by that rule.
    If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.
    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.
    You may assume that all words will have the same length.    
    """
    # Filter out strings with odd lengths
    even_length_strings = [s for s in lst if len(s) % 2 == 0]
    # Sort the remaining strings by length, then alphabetically for equal lengths
    sorted_even_length_strings = sorted(even_length_strings, key=lambda x: (len(x), x))
    return sorted_even_length_strings

# Run the unit tests
from my_tests import run_tests
run_tests(sorted_list_sum)
```

This code should now execute without errors and run the tests specified in `my_tests.py` on your implementation of `sorted_list_sum`.
