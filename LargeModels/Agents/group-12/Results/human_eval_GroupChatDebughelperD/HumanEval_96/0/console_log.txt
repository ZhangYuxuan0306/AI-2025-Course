The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `count_up_to`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `count_up_to`. However, `count_up_to` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `count_up_to` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(count_up_to)`, as well as count_up_to's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
    for example:
    count_up_to(5) => [2,3]
    count_up_to(11) => [2,3,5,7]
    count_up_to(0) => []
    count_up_to(20) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]
    count_up_to(1) => []
    count_up_to(18) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17]
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(count_up_to)
```

coder (to chat_manager):

Certainly! Below is the completed code block that includes the `count_up_to` function along with a call to `run_tests` to run the automated unit tests. Note that the actual implementation of the `is_prime` helper function is included as well, which is used by `count_up_to`.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def is_prime(num):
    """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True



def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that returns an array of the first n integers that are prime numbers and less than n."""
    result = []
    for number in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(number):
            result.append(number)
    return result



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(count_up_to)
```

This code should now be able to run the `count_up_to` function and its associated unit tests directly.
