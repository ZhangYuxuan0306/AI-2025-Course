The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `f`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `f`. However, `f` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `f` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(f)`, as well as f's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def f(n):
    """ Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,
    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
    i starts from 1.
    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
    Example:
    f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(f)
```
