Complete the implementation of `eat` and output\na new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing\n`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(eat)`, as well as eat's complete definition,\nsuch that this code block can be run directly in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef eat(number, need, remaining):\n    \"\"\"\n    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,\n    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.\n    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,\n                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]\n    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.\n    \n    Example:\n    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]\n    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]\n    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]\n    * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]\n    \n    Variables:\n    @number : integer\n        the number of carrots that you have eaten.\n    @need : integer\n        the number of carrots that you need to eat.\n    @remaining : integer\n        the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock\n    \n    Constrain:\n    * 0 <= number <= 1000\n    * 0 <= need <= 1000\n    * 0 <= remaining <= 1000\n\n    Have fun :)\n    \"\"\"\n\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(eat)\n```\n",
