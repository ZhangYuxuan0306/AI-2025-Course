The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `simplify`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `simplify`. However, `simplify` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `simplify` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(simplify)`, as well as simplify's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def simplify(x, n):
    """Your task is to implement a function that will simplify the expression
    x * n. The function returns True if x * n evaluates to a whole number and False
    otherwise. Both x and n, are string representation of a fraction, and have the following format,
    <numerator>/<denominator> where both numerator and denominator are positive whole numbers.

    You can assume that x, and n are valid fractions, and do not have zero as denominator.

    simplify("1/5", "5/1") = True
    simplify("1/6", "2/1") = False
    simplify("7/10", "10/2") = False
    """



# Run the unit tests
