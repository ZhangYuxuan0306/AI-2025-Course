user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `int_to_mini_roman`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `int_to_mini_roman`. However, `int_to_mini_roman` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `int_to_mini_roman` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(int_to_mini_roman)`, as well as int_to_mini_roman's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def int_to_mini_roman(number):
    """
    Given a positive integer, obtain its roman numeral equivalent as a string,
    and return it in lowercase.
    Restrictions: 1 <= num <= 1000

    Examples:
    >>> int_to_mini_roman(19) == 'xix'
    >>> int_to_mini_roman(152) == 'clii'
    >>> int_to_mini_roman(426) == 'cdxxvi'
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(int_to_mini_roman)
