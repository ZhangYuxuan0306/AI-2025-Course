This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the\ncorrect implementation of `get_closest_vowel`. However, `get_closest_vowel` is only partially\nimplemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `get_closest_vowel` and output\na new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing\n`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(get_closest_vowel)`, as well as get_closest_vowel's complete definition,\nsuch that this code block can be run directly in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef get_closest_vowel(word):\n    \"\"\"You are given a word. Your task is to find the closest vowel that stands between \n    two consonants from the right side of the word (case sensitive).\n    \n    Vowels in the beginning and ending doesn't count. Return empty string if you didn't\n    find any vowel met the above condition. \n\n    You may assume that the given string contains English letter only.\n\n    Example:\n    get_closest_vowel(\"yogurt\") ==> \"u\"\n    get_closest_vowel(\"FULL\") ==> \"U\"\n    get_closest_vowel(\"quick\") ==> \"\"\n    get_closest_vowel(\"ab\") ==> \"\"\n    \"\"\"\n\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(get_closest_vowel)\n```\n",
