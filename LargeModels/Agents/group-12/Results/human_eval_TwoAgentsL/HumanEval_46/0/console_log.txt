The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `fib4`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `fib4`. However, `fib4` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `fib4` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(fib4)`, as well as fib4's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def fib4(n: int):
    """The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence.  Do not use recursion.
    >>> fib4(5)
    4
    >>> fib4(6)
    8
    >>> fib4(7)
    14
