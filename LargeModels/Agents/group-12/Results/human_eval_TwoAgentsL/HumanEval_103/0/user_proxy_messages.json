This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the\ncorrect implementation of `rounded_avg`. However, `rounded_avg` is only partially\nimplemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `rounded_avg` and output\na new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing\n`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(rounded_avg)`, as well as rounded_avg's complete definition,\nsuch that this code block can be run directly in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef rounded_avg(n, m):\n    \"\"\"You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the\n    average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). \n    Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.\n    If n is greater than m, return -1.\n    Example:\n    rounded_avg(1, 5) => \"0b11\"\n    rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1\n    rounded_avg(10, 20) => \"0b1111\"\n    rounded_avg(20, 33) => \"0b11010\"\n    \"\"\"\n\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(rounded_avg)\n```\n",
