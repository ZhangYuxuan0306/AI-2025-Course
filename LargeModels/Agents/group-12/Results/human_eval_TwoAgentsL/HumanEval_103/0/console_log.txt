The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `rounded_avg`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `rounded_avg`. However, `rounded_avg` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `rounded_avg` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(rounded_avg)`, as well as rounded_avg's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def rounded_avg(n, m):
    """You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the
    average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). 
    Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.
    If n is greater than m, return -1.
    Example:
    rounded_avg(1, 5) => "0b11"
    rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1
    rounded_avg(10, 20) => "0b1111"
    rounded_avg(20, 33) => "0b11010"
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(rounded_avg)
```

    count = m - n + 1
