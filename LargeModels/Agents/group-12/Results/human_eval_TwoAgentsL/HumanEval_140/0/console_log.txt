The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `fix_spaces`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `fix_spaces`. However, `fix_spaces` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `fix_spaces` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(fix_spaces)`, as well as fix_spaces's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def fix_spaces(text):
    """
    Given a string text, replace all spaces in it with underscores, 
    and if a string has more than 2 consecutive spaces, 
    then replace all consecutive spaces with - 
    
    fix_spaces("Example") == "Example"
    fix_spaces("Example 1") == "Example_1"
    fix_spaces(" Example 2") == "_Example_2"
    fix_spaces(" Example   3") == "_Example-3"
    """



# Run the unit tests
