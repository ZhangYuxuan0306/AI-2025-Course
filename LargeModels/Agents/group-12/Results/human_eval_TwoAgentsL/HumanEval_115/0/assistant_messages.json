This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the\ncorrect implementation of `max_fill`. However, `max_fill` is only partially\nimplemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `max_fill` and output\na new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing\n`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(max_fill)`, as well as max_fill's complete definition,\nsuch that this code block can be run directly in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef max_fill(grid, capacity):\n    import math\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,\n    and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.\n    Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, \n    and all buckets have the same capacity.\n    Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.\n    Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.\n\n    Example 1:\n        Input: \n            grid : [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]\n            bucket_capacity : 1\n        Output: 6\n\n    Example 2:\n        Input: \n            grid : [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]\n            bucket_capacity : 2\n        Output: 5\n    \n    Example 3:\n        Input: \n            grid : [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]\n            bucket_capacity : 5\n        Output: 0\n\n    Constraints:\n        * all wells have the same length\n        * 1 <= grid.length <= 10^2\n        * 1 <= grid[:,1].length <= 10^2\n        * grid[i][j] -> 0 | 1\n        * 1 <= capacity <= 10\n    \"\"\"\n\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(max_fill)\n```\n",
