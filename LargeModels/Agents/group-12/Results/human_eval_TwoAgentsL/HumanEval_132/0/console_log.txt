The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `is_nested`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `is_nested`. However, `is_nested` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `is_nested` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(is_nested)`, as well as is_nested's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def is_nested(string):
    '''
    Create a function that takes a string as input which contains only square brackets.
    The function should return True if and only if there is a valid subsequence of brackets 
    where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.

    is_nested('[]]]]]]][[[[[]') ➞ False

It seems that the code is not correctly identifying if a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested. Let's try to fix it by checking if there are any unclosed brackets at the end and ensuring nested condition.

Here's an updated version of your `is_nested` function:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def is_nested(string):
    stack = []

    for char in string:
        if char == '[':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ']' and len(stack) > 0:
            stack.pop()
    
    # If there are no unclosed brackets, it could potentially be nested
    if not stack:
        # Check if the sequence can have a subsequence that is strictly nested.
        return len(string) >= 3
    
    # Otherwise, it cannot be a properly nested sequence
    return False

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(is_nested)
```

It seems like there is still an issue with the implementation of `is_nested`. Let's try to address it more carefully:

1. We need to ensure that there is at least one nested subsequence.
2. If the stack is empty by the end, it means all brackets are properly closed and we can check for nested subsequence.

Here’s a refined version:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def is_nested(string):
    stack = []
    has_nesting = False
    
    for char in string:
        if char == '[':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ']' and len(stack) > 0:
            stack.pop()
            # Check for nesting: If there are still brackets left after popping, it means there is nesting.
            if len(stack) > 0:
                has_nesting = True
        else:
            # Invalid character detected
            return False
    
    # Return True only if the string has a legal nesting and all brackets are closed.
    return len(stack) == 0 and has_nesting

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(is_nested)
```

It appears that there is still an issue with `is_nested`. Let's revise the implementation again:

1. Stack to keep track of brackets.
2. Flag to check if there has been any nested subsequence detected.

Here’s a more detailed attempt at fixing it:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def is_nested(string):
    stack = []
    nested = False
    
    for char in string:
        if char == '[':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ']' and stack:
            stack.pop()
            if len(stack) > 0:  # If there are still brackets left after popping, it means there is nesting
                nested = True
        else:
            return False  # Invalid character detected
    
    # Return True only if the sequence has a legal nesting and all brackets are closed.
    return nested and not stack

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(is_nested)
```
