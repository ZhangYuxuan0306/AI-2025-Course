The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `sum_squares`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `sum_squares`. However, `sum_squares` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `sum_squares` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(sum_squares)`, as well as sum_squares's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def sum_squares(lst):
    """You are given a list of numbers.
    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,
    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14
    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98
    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84
    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29
    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6
    

    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(sum_squares)
```

assistant (to user_proxy):

Here's a complete implementation of `sum_squares` and the code needed to run the tests:

```python
from math import ceil
from my_tests import run_tests

def sum_squares(lst):
    """You are given a list of numbers.
    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,
    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14
    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98
    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84
    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29
    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6
    """
    return sum(ceil(num)**2 for num in lst)

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(sum_squares)
```

You can copy and paste this code into a Python environment to run the tests for `sum_squares`.
