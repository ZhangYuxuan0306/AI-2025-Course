The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `exchange`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `exchange`. However, `exchange` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `exchange` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(exchange)`, as well as exchange's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    """In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,
    and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements
    between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
    There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
    all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".
    Otherwise, return "NO".
    For example:
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "YES"
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"
    It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.
    """



# Run the unit tests
