The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `sort_third`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `sort_third`. However, `sort_third` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `sort_third` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(sort_third)`, as well as sort_third's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

It seems like there are still some issues with the implementation of `sort_third`. Let's try a simpler approach to sorting the elements at indices divisible by three.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal

    """
    # Extract elements at indices divisible by three
    divisible_by_three = [l[i] for i in range(2, len(l), 3)]
    
    # Sort these elements
    divisible_by_three.sort()
    
    # Create a copy of the original list to modify
    sorted_indices = l[:]
    
    # Replace elements at indices divisible by three with sorted values
    sorted_index = 0
    for i in range(2, len(l), 3):
        sorted_indices[i] = divisible_by_three[sorted_index]
        sorted_index += 1
    
    return sorted_indices

It looks like there are still some discrepancies between the expected and actual outputs. Let's debug by expanding the print statements in `sort_third` to ensure we understand what values are being processed at each stage.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal

It seems there's an issue in the logic where we are trying to replace elements at indices divisible by three. We should avoid reassigning `sorted_indices` inside the loop, and instead use a different list for the sorted elements.

Here is the corrected version of the `sort_third` function:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """
    # Extract elements at indices divisible by three
    if sorted_indices := [l[i] for i in range(2, len(l), 3)]:
        print("Divisible by Three Elements:", sorted_indices)
        sorted_indices.sort()
        print("Sorted Divisible by Three Elements:", sorted_indices)
        
        # Create a copy of the original list to modify
        result = l[:]
        
        # Replace elements at indices divisible by three with sorted values
        sorted_index = 0
        for i in range(2, len(l), 3):
            print(f"Replacing element at index {i} with {sorted_indices[sorted_index]}")
            result[i] = sorted_indices[sorted_index]
            sorted_index += 1
    
    return result


# Run the unit tests
