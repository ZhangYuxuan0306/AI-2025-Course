The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `Strongest_Extension`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `Strongest_Extension`. However, `Strongest_Extension` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `Strongest_Extension` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(Strongest_Extension)`, as well as Strongest_Extension's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    """You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions.
    The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The
    strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase
    letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters 
    in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. 
    You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this 
    format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.
    If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should
    choose the one that comes first in the list.
    For example, if you are given "Slices" as the class and a list of the
    extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should
    return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension 
    (its strength is -1).
    Example:
    for Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']) == 'my_class.AA'
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(Strongest_Extension)
```
