/workspace/scenario.py:25: DeprecationWarning: `autogen.config_list_from_json(...)` is deprecated. Please use the "autogen.LLMConfig.from_json(path="OAI_CONFIG_LIST")" method instead. Scheduled for removal in 0.11.0 version.

The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `remove_vowels`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `remove_vowels`. However, `remove_vowels` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `remove_vowels` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(remove_vowels)`, as well as remove_vowels's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def remove_vowels(text):
    """
    remove_vowels is a function that takes string and returns string without vowels.
    >>> remove_vowels('')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")
    'bcdf\nghjklm'
    >>> remove_vowels('abcdef')
    'bcdf'
    >>> remove_vowels('aaaaa')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels('aaBAA')
    'B'
    >>> remove_vowels('zbcd')
