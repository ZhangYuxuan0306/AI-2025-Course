The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `remove_duplicates`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `remove_duplicates`. However, `remove_duplicates` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `remove_duplicates` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(remove_duplicates)`, as well as remove_duplicates's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

from typing import List


def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(remove_duplicates)
```

It looks like the initial implementation still needs some work. Let's try a different approach using a dictionary to keep track of counts.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

from typing import List


def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    count = {}
    for number in numbers:
        if number not in count:
            count[number] = 1
        else:
            count[number] += 1
    
    result = [number for number, cnt in count.items() if cnt == 1]
    return result


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(remove_duplicates)
```
