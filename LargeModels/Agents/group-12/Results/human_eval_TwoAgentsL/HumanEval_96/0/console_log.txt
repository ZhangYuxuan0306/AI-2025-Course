The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `count_up_to`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `count_up_to`. However, `count_up_to` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `count_up_to` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(count_up_to)`, as well as count_up_to's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
    for example:
    count_up_to(5) => [2,3]
    count_up_to(11) => [2,3,5,7]
    count_up_to(0) => []
    count_up_to(20) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]

It looks like the test failed. Let's refine the `count_up_to` function to ensure it correctly identifies and counts prime numbers. Here is the updated code:

It seems that the test cases are still failing. Let's ensure the `count_up_to` function handles all edge cases correctly, particularly when `n` is zero or negative.

Here's an updated version of the code:

It appears that there are still issues with the test cases. Let's carefully review the expected behavior and ensure our implementation correctly identifies prime numbers and handles edge cases, particularly when `n` is zero or negative.

Here's an additional refinement to make sure all test cases pass:

```python

It seems that even after refining, there are still test failures. Let's closely inspect the expected and actual outputs for each failing test case, ensuring our logic is accurately identifying prime numbers and counting them correctly.

Here is another refined version of the code with debug prints to help with diagnosing the issues:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):

            return False
    return True

def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n prime numbers less than n.
    
    Note: This implementation assumes that 'n' is always zero or positive, as negative numbers will not yield any prime numbers.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return []

    primes = []
    num = 2
    while len(primes) < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            primes.append(num)
            print(f"Added {num} to primes: {primes}")
        num += 1

    return primes


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(count_up_to)
```

Make sure to pay close attention to the debug prints and compare them with the expected outputs of the failing test cases. This should help you identify any issues in your logic.
