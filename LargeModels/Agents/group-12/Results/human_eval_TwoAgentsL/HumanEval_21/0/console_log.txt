The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `rescale_to_unit`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `rescale_to_unit`. However, `rescale_to_unit` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `rescale_to_unit` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(rescale_to_unit)`, as well as rescale_to_unit's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

from typing import List


def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
    [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
