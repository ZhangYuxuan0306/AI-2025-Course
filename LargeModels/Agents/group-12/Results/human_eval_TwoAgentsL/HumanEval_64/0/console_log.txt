The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `vowels_count`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `vowels_count`. However, `vowels_count` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `vowels_count` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(vowels_count)`, as well as vowels_count's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


FIX = """
Add more test cases.
"""

def vowels_count(s):
    """Write a function vowels_count which takes a string representing
    a word as input and returns the number of vowels in the string.
    Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. Here, 'y' is also a
    vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.

    Example:
    >>> vowels_count("abcde")
