The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `order_by_points`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `order_by_points`. However, `order_by_points` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `order_by_points` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(order_by_points)`, as well as order_by_points's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def order_by_points(nums):
    """
    Write a function which sorts the given list of integers
    in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.
    Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,
    order them based on their index in original list.

    For example:
    >>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
    >>> order_by_points([]) == []
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(order_by_points)
```
