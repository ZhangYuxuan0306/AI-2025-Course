The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `minPath`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `minPath`. However, `minPath` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `minPath` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(minPath)`, as well as minPath's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def minPath(grid, k):
    """
    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
    cell.
    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
    necessarily distinct).
    You CANNOT go off the grid.
    A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
    through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
    than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
    such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
    Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

    Examples:

        Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
        Output: [1, 2, 1]

        Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1
        Output: [1]

It seems that the current implementation of `minPath` is not correct and the tests are failing. Please provide a complete, correct, and optimized implementation of `minPath`, ensuring it addresses all the given requirements and constraints.

If you need assistance with finding a solution or debugging the code, feel free to ask!
