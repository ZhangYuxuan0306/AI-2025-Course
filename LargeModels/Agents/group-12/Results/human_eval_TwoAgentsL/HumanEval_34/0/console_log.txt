The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `unique`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `unique`. However, `unique` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `unique` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(unique)`, as well as unique's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list
    >>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(unique)
```
