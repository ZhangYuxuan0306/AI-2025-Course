This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the\ncorrect implementation of `decimal_to_binary`. However, `decimal_to_binary` is only partially\nimplemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `decimal_to_binary` and output\na new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing\n`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(decimal_to_binary)`, as well as decimal_to_binary's complete definition,\nsuch that this code block can be run directly in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef decimal_to_binary(decimal):\n    \"\"\"You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert it to\n    binary format. The function should return a string, with each character representing a binary\n    number. Each character in the string will be '0' or '1'.\n\n    There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.\n    The extra characters are there to help with the format.\n\n    Examples:\n    decimal_to_binary(15)   # returns \"db1111db\"\n    decimal_to_binary(32)   # returns \"db100000db\"\n    \"\"\"\n\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(decimal_to_binary)\n```\n",
