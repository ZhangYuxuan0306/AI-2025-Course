The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `specialFilter`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `specialFilter`. However, `specialFilter` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `specialFilter` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(specialFilter)`, as well as specialFilter's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def specialFilter(nums):
    """Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns 
    the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both 
    first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
    For example:
    specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]) => 1 
    specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) => 2
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(specialFilter)
```
