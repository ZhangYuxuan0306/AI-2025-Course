This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the\ncorrect implementation of `get_odd_collatz`. However, `get_odd_collatz` is only partially\nimplemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `get_odd_collatz` and output\na new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing\n`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(get_odd_collatz)`, as well as get_odd_collatz's complete definition,\nsuch that this code block can be run directly in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef get_odd_collatz(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.\n\n    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined\n    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the \n    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of \n    the previous term.
