The problem seems to be with the calculation of the count of numbers that start or end with 1.\n\nLet's review the logic and make necessary adjustments:\n\n1. **Counting n-digit numbers starting with 1:**\n   - For n=1, there is only one number: 1.\n   - For n > 1, a number starting with 1 can be written as `1xxxx...x`, where x can be any digit from 0 to 9. There are \\(10^{(n-1)}\\) such numbers.\n\n2. **Counting n-digit numbers ending with 1:**\n   - Similarly, a number ending with 1 can be written as `xxxx...x1`.\n   - The first (n-1) digits can be anything from 1 to 9 for the number to have n digits. So, there are \\(9 \\times 10^{(n-2)}\\) such numbers.\n\n3. **Avoiding double-counting:**\n   - Numbers that both start and end with 1 are counted twice in the above two counts, so subtract these from the total.\n   - A number that starts and ends with 1 can be written as `1xxxx...x1`.\n   - The first digit is fixed as 1, and the last digit is also fixed as 1.
