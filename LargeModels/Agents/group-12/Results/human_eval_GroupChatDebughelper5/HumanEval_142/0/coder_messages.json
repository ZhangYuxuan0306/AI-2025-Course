Complete the implementation of `sum_squares` and output\na new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing\n`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(sum_squares)`, as well as sum_squares's complete definition,\nsuch that this code block can be run directly in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\n\n\ndef sum_squares(lst):\n    \"\"\"\"\n    This function will take a list of integers. For all entries in the list, the function shall square the integer entry if its index is a \n    multiple of 3 and will cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will not \n    change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries. \n    \n    Examples:\n    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 6\n    For lst = []  the output should be 0\n    For lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]  the output should be -126\n    \"\"\"\n\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(sum_squares)\n```\n",
