degub_agent (to chat_manager):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `is_prime`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `is_prime`. However, `is_prime` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `is_prime` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(is_prime)`, as well as is_prime's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.
    >>> is_prime(6)
    False
    >>> is_prime(101)
    True
    >>> is_prime(11)
    True
    >>> is_prime(13441)
    True
    >>> is_prime(61)
    True
    >>> is_prime(4)
    False
    >>> is_prime(1)
    False
    """



# Run the unit tests
