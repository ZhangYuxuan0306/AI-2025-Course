The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `skjkasdkd`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `skjkasdkd`. However, `skjkasdkd` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `skjkasdkd` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(skjkasdkd)`, as well as skjkasdkd's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def skjkasdkd(lst):
    """You are given a list of integers.
    You need to find the largest prime value and return the sum of its digits.

    Examples:
    For lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] the output should be 10
    For lst = [1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1] the output should be 25
    For lst = [1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3] the output should be 13
    For lst = [0,724,32,71,99,32,6,0,5,91,83,0,5,6] the output should be 11
    For lst = [0,81,12,3,1,21] the output should be 3

degub_agent (to chat_manager):

The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `largest_prime` remains `None` when no prime numbers are found in the list. In the function `skjkasdkd`, if no prime number is present, the variable `largest_prime` remains `None`. When you try to use `max(largest_prime, number)`, this causes a TypeError because it's trying to compare a `NoneType` with an integer.

To fix this issue, before finding the largest prime, ensure that you initialize `largest_prime` to a large negative number or zero (or any other non-prime number). This way, when it encounters the first prime number in the list, it will correctly update `largest_prime`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def skjkasdkd(lst):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        if n <= 3:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
            return False
        i = 5
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
                return False
            i += 6
        return True

    def sum_of_digits(n):
        return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

    largest_prime = -1  # Initialize to a non-prime number

    for number in lst:
        if is_prime(number):
            largest_prime = max(largest_prime, number)

    if largest_prime != -1:  # Check again to ensure it's not still -1
        return sum_of_digits(largest_prime)
    else:
        return 0

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(skjkasdkd)
```

This should resolve the TypeError and allow the `skjkasdkd` function to work as expected.

coder (to chat_manager):

Great! The code now correctly initializes `largest_prime` before trying to use it in comparisons, and it handles cases where no prime numbers are found by returning 0 instead of raising an error. Thank you for your assistance! If you have any more questions or need further modifications, feel free to ask.
