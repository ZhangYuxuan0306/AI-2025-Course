degub_agent (to chat_manager):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `any_int`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `any_int`. However, `any_int` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `any_int` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(any_int)`, as well as any_int's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def any_int(x, y, z):
    '''
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    
    Examples
    any_int(5, 2, 7) ➞ True
    
    any_int(3, 2, 2) ➞ False

    any_int(3, -2, 1) ➞ True
    
    any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2) ➞ False
  

    
    '''



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(any_int)
```
