If you are looking for a more realistic approach, especially considering that `my_tests.py` is part of a larger suite of tests, I'll provide a framework that demonstrates how you might structure this in a real-world scenario.\n\nAssuming `my_tests.py` contains an implementation of `run_tests`, here's how you could organize your code:\n\n1. Ensure `my_tests.py` has a definition for `run_tests`.\n2. Include `match_parens` within the `my_tests` module or import it as needed.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you might structure your code:\n\n```python\n# my_tests.py - Define run_tests and other tests here\ndef run_tests(test_function):\n    test_cases = {\n        \"test_1\": \"match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'\",\n        \"test_2\": \"match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No'\",\n        # Add more test cases as needed\n    }\n\n    for key, value in test_cases.items():\n        result = eval(value)\n        if result:\n            print(f\"Test '{key}' passed.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Test '{key}' failed.\")\n\ndef test_match_parens(lst):\n    assert match_parens(lst) == 'Yes', \"Test case 1 failed\"\n    assert match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No', \"Test case 2 failed\"\n\n# Run the tests using the run_tests function from my_tests\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import my_tests\n    # Assuming my_tests.run_tests is defined to accept a function as an argument\n    my_tests.run_tests(test_match_parens)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`my_tests.py`:** This is where you would define your `run_tests` function. In this example, it runs predefined test cases.\n- **`test_match_parens`:** This is a function that uses assertions to check if the `match_parens` function returns the expected result for specific inputs.\n- **Main Block:** If you run this script directly, `my_tests.run_tests(test_match_parens)` will execute the tests.\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Testing Framework:** The example demonstrates using predefined test cases and assertions to verify the function's correctness. This is a common approach in larger testing suites.\n- **Avoid Hardcoded Evaluations:** In a real-world application, you should avoid `eval` for evaluating strings as code for security reasons. Instead, use a proper testing framework that supports dynamic execution of code.\n\nThis structure allows you to run your tests seamlessly without needing to import external test files directly in your script.",

Let's walk through the steps again to ensure everything is correctly set up and tested.\n\n### Step-by-Step Setup:\n\n#### 1. **Ensure Python Environment:**\n   - Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.\n   - Verify the Python version (e.g., using `python --version` or `python3 --version`).\n\n#### 2. **Create a New Directory for Your Project:**\n   - Create a new directory and navigate into it:\n     ```bash\n     mkdir my_project\n     cd my_project\n     ```\n\n#### 3. **Initialize a Virtual Environment:**\n   - It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.\n   - Run the following command to create a virtual environment named `venv`:\n     ```bash\n     python -m venv venv\n     ```\n   - Activate the virtual environment. On Windows, use:\n     ```shell\n     .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate\n     ```\n   - On macOS/Linux, use:\n     ```bash\n     source venv/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n#### 4. **Install Required Libraries:**\n   - Ensure you have `pytest` installed, which is a popular testing framework for Python:\n     ```bash\n     pip install pytest\n     ```\n\n#### 5. **Create the Project Structure:**\n\n- **my_project**: The main directory.\n  - **my_tests.py**: A file containing the test cases and any helper functions.\n  - **your_code.py**: Your implementation of `match_parens`.\n\n```plaintext\nmy_project/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 my_tests.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 your_code.py\n```\n\n#### 6. **Write the Code:**\n\n- In `my_code.py`, implement the `match_parens` function:\n\n  ```python\n  def match_parens(lst):\n      '''\n      You are given a list of two strings, both strings consist of open\n      parentheses '(' or close parentheses ')' only.\n      Your job is to check if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in\n      some order, that the resulting string will be good.\n      A string S is considered to be good if and only if all parentheses in S\n      are balanced.
