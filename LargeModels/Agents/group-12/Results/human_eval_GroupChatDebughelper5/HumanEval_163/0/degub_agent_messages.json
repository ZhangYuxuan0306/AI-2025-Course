The issue might lie in the comparison within the loop or in how the function handles non-zero values.\n\nLet's ensure that the loop bounds are inclusive and that the logic for filtering even digits is applied correctly:\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\"\n    if a == 0 and b == 0:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    for num in range(min(a, b), max(a, b) + 1):  # This line seems correct\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(generate_integers)\n```\n\nThe function should now correctly generate all even numbers between two given positive integers, including when one or both of them are zero. Let's ensure there are no other issues with the function logic or edge cases.\n\nIf the problem persists, it might be helpful to run the function step-by-step with specific inputs to see where the values deviate from what is expected.",
