The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `eat`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `eat`. However, `eat` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `eat` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(eat)`, as well as eat's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def eat(number, need, remaining):
    """
    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,
    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,
                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]
    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
    
    Example:
    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
    * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]
    
    Variables:
    @number : integer
        the number of carrots that you have eaten.
    @need : integer
        the number of carrots that you need to eat.
    @remaining : integer
        the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock
    
    Constrain:
    * 0 <= number <= 1000
    * 0 <= need <= 1000
    * 0 <= remaining <= 1000

    Have fun :)

# Run the unit tests

coder (to chat_manager):

To complete the implementation of the `eat` function and run the automated unit tests using the provided code, you need to ensure that it handles different scenarios correctly based on the values of `number`, `need`, and `remaining`. Here is the updated code block:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def eat(number, need, remaining):
    """
    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,
    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,
                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]
    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
    
    Example:
    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
    * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]
    
    Variables:
    @number : integer
        the number of carrots that you have eaten.
    @need : integer
        the number of carrots that you need to eat.
    @remaining : integer
        the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock
    
    Constrain:
    * 0 <= number <= 1000
    * 0 <= need <= 1000
    * 0 <= remaining <= 1000

    Have fun :)
    """
    
    if need <= remaining:
        return [number + need, remaining - need]
    else:
        return [number + remaining, 0]


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(eat)
```

This code defines the `eat` function, which calculates how many carrots to eat and how many will remain based on the inputs. It also includes the call to `run_tests(eat)` at the end to execute the automated unit tests.
