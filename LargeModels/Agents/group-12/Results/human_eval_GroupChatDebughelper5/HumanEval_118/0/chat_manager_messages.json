Let's analyze the code and fix it.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The function iterates over the word from index 1 to `len(word) - 2` because we do not consider vowels at the beginning (index 0) or the end (index `len(word) - 1`) for proximity to consonants.\n- If a vowel is found between two consonants, it assigns that vowel to `closest_vowel`.\n- If no such vowel is found by the time the loop completes, it returns an empty string.\n\n### Fixes:\n1. **Check Vowels at Edge Cases:** Ensure that vowels are checked within the loop boundaries (from 1 to `len(word) - 2`).\n2. **Return Correct Vowel if Found:** Return the vowel found, or an empty string if no matching sequence is found.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef get_closest_vowel(word):\n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    \n    for i in range(1, len(word) - 1):\n        # Check if the current character and the next one are consonants\n        if word[i] not in vowels and word[i + 1] in vowels:\n            closest_vowel = word[i + 1]\n            break\n    \n    else:  # If no such vowel is found, return an empty string\n        closest_vowel = \"\"\n\n    return closest_vowel\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(get_closest_vowel)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n- The `else` clause in the loop now correctly sets `closest_vowel` to an empty string if no qualifying vowel is found.\n- This change ensures that `get_closest_vowel(\"FULL\")` and `get_closest_vowel(\"ab\")` return an empty string as expected.",
