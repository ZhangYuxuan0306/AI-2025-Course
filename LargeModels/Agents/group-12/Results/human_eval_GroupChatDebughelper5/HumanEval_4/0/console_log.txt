/workspace/scenario.py:25: DeprecationWarning: `autogen.config_list_from_json(...)` is deprecated. Please use the "autogen.LLMConfig.from_json(path="OAI_CONFIG_LIST")" method instead. Scheduled for removal in 0.11.0 version.

degub_agent (to chat_manager):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `mean_absolute_deviation`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `mean_absolute_deviation`. However, `mean_absolute_deviation` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `mean_absolute_deviation` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(mean_absolute_deviation)`, as well as mean_absolute_deviation's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

from typing import List


def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(mean_absolute_deviation)
```
