Complete the implementation of `anti_shuffle` and output\na new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing\n`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(anti_shuffle)`, as well as anti_shuffle's complete definition,\nsuch that this code block can be run directly in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef anti_shuffle(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.\n    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)\n    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in\n    ascending order based on ascii value.\n    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.\n\n    For example:\n    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'\n    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'\n    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'\n    \"\"\"\n\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(anti_shuffle)\n```\n",
