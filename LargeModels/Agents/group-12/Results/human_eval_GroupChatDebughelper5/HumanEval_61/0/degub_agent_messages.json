It increments the counter for each opening bracket and decrements it for each closing bracket. If at any point the balance becomes negative, it means there is a closing bracket without a matching opening bracket, so the function returns `False`. After processing all characters, if the balance is zero, it means every opening bracket has been matched with a closing bracket, so the function returns `True`. Finally, the code runs the unit tests using the `run_tests` function.",
