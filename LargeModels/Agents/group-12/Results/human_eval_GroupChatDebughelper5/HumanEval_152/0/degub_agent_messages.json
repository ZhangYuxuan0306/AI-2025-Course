This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the\ncorrect implementation of `compare`. However, `compare` is only partially\nimplemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `compare` and output\na new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing\n`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(compare)`, as well as compare's complete definition,\nsuch that this code block can be run directly in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef compare(game,guess):\n    \"\"\"I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited\n    event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are\n    definitely worth noting down and comparing.\n    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.\n    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. \n    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,\n    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n    \n    \n    example:\n\n    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]\n    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]\n    \"\"\"\n\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(compare)\n```\n",
