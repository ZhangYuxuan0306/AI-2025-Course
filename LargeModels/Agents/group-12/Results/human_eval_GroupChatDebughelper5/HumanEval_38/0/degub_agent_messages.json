This suggests that the code block where your `decode_cyclic` function definition lives does not have access to the `encode_cyclic` function from another file, which is what the error message \"name 'encode_cyclic' is not defined\" implies.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to ensure that `encode_cyclic` is either:\n\n1. Defined within the same module.\n2. Imported from a separate module where both functions are defined.\n\nHere's how you can define and import the necessary functions in a single file or by splitting them into different files:\n\n### Option 1: Define Functions in the Same File\n\nYou can directly define `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` within the same file. However, to keep your code organized, it's generally better to split them into separate files.\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\ndef encode_cyclic(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.\n    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]\n    # cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer than 3.\n    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]\n    return \"\".join(groups)\n\n\ndef decode_cyclic(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # reverse the encoding process by cycling each group back\n    decoded_groups = [group[2:] + group[:2] if len(group) == 3 else group for group in s]\n    \n    return \"\".join(decoded_groups)\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(decode_cyclic)\n```\n\n### Option 2: Import Functions from a Separate File\n\nIf the `encode_cyclic` function is defined in another file, you need to import it. For example, let's assume `encode_cyclic` is defined in a file named `encoder.py`.\n\n#### encoder.py\n```python\ndef encode_cyclic(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.\n    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]\n    # cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer than 3.\n    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]\n    return \"\".join(groups)\n```\n\n#### main.py\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\nimport encoder\n\ndef decode_cyclic(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # reverse the encoding process by cycling each group back\n    decoded_groups = [group[2:] + group[:2] if len(group) == 3 else group for group in s]\n    \n    return \"\".join(decoded_groups)\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(decode_cyclic)\n```\n\nIn this second option, make sure that you have properly set up your environment (e.g., by installing any required packages or ensuring that module paths are correctly configured).

Let's go with Option 2, which involves splitting the functions into separate files: `encoder.py` for `encode_cyclic` and another file, `main.py`, where both `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` are defined.\n\nHere\u2019s the complete code structure:\n\n1. **encoder.py**:\n   - Contains the `encode_cyclic` function.\n\n2. **main.py**:\n   - Imports `encode_cyclic` from `encoder.py`.\n   - Defines the `decode_cyclic` function.\n   - Runs the unit tests using `my_tests`.\n\n### encoder.py\n\n```python\ndef encode_cyclic(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # split string to groups.

For example:\n     ```sh\n     python main.py\n     ```\n\n3. **Update PYTHONPATH** (if necessary):\n   - If the modules are in different directories, you can update your environment variable to include these directories.

Verify File Paths\nIf there are any special or hidden characters in your file path (like spaces), ensure that they are correctly handled. You can also try using a command like `find /workspace/coding/main.py` to locate the file.\n\n### Example Directory Structure\nEnsure you have the following structure:\n\n```\n/workspace/coding/\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 encoder.py\n```\n\nIf you follow these steps, it should resolve the \"No such file or directory\" error and allow you to run your program successfully.",
