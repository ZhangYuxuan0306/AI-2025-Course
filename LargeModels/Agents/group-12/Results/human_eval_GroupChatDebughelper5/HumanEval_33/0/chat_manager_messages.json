This suggests there might be an issue with how you are defining and running the function.\n\nHere are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve this:\n\n1. **Ensure Function Definition:` Check that the `sort_third` function is defined within the same file where you are running the test cases. You can simply check by typing `print(sort_third)` at the end of your script. If it prints an error, the function is not being found.\n\n2. **Verify File Structure:** Ensure that `my_tests.py` is in the same directory as your main script and that there are no typos or issues with importing `sort_third`. You can test this by running `my_tests.py` directly to see if it behaves as expected before using it to run tests through other scripts.\n\n3. **Use Import Statement:** Use an import statement at the beginning of your script to ensure that `sort_third` is accessible. For example:\n   ```python\n   from my_tests import sort_third\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Typos:** Double-check for any typos in the function name or import statements. Ensure that all necessary functions and variables are correctly named.\n\n5. **Isolation Test:** Run your `sort_third` function in a standalone script before trying to run it through tests. This will help verify the implementation and confirm that there are no issues with how the function is defined.\n\nHere's an example of how you might set up your main file to test `sort_third`:\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import sort_third\nimport unittest\n\nclass TestSortThird(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_sort_third(self):\n        self.assertListEqual(sort_third([1, 2, 3]), [1, 2, 3])\n        self.assertListEqual(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]), [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5])\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nMake sure to run this script directly using Python.
