The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `how_many_times`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `how_many_times`. However, `how_many_times` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `how_many_times` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(how_many_times)`, as well as how_many_times's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """ Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string. Count overlaping cases.
    >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
    0
    >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
    3
    >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
    3
    """



# Run the unit tests

The issue lies in the behavior of the `find` method. The `find` method searches for the substring starting from the specified position and returns -1 if it is not found, which causes the loop to exit when no more occurrences are found after a match.

To handle overlapping occurrences correctly, you should use slicing and the `count` method in Python. Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """ Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string. Count overlapping cases.
    >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
    0
    >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
    3
    >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
    3
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(string) - len(substring) + 1):
        if string[i:i+len(substring)] == substring:
            count += 1
    return count

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(how_many_times)
```

This version of `how_many_times` iterates through the string, checking for the substring starting at each position and counts all overlapping occurrences. This should now pass all the test cases without raising an assertion error.

I see the issue with the previous implementation. The `find` method was incorrect because it returns -1 when no more occurrences are found after a match, which breaks the loop prematurely. Instead, we can use slicing and the `count()` method to count overlapping substrings.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """ Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string. Count overlapping cases.
    >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
    0
    >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
    3
    >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
    3
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(string) - len(substring) + 1):
        if string[i:i+len(substring)] == substring:
            count += 1
    return count

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(how_many_times)
```

This implementation uses a loop to check each possible starting position of the substring, allowing for overlapping matches. The `count()` method is not needed here as we are counting all occurrences, including overlaps.
